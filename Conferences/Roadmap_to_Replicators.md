## Prof. Neil Gershenfeld - Roadmap to Replicators - CDFAM Keynote Presentation



[Applause] thank you I'm delighted to join you

0:13

um it's been a long day so if you need to wave your arms or jump up and down or walk around feel free

0:19

so I wanted uh and end the day by looking ahead to what what is my version

0:26

of a road map to a replicator and in doing that I want to peel apart a bunch

0:31

of assumptions that I've heard through the day that sound obvious but you really have to revisit as we go through

0:37

those stages so I never understood the difference between computer science and physical science I'm in a TED Talk I

0:45

said computer science was one of the worst things to happen to computers or to science because it's unphysical

0:51

and so CBA was created to work at that boundary and it led to things like the first Quantum computations we were part

0:58

of creating the first synthetic Life part of creating internet of things and

1:04

to look at the road map let's start with 1952 uh there's one Earth there was one

1:10

Whirlwind computer at MIT and there was the first NC Mill so this was the birth

1:15

of computer controlled Machining at MIT for extra credit if you want to read about it MIT actually stole it it would

1:22

it's an interesting and a very messy history I can tell you about later but that was the birth of computer-controlled Machining my lab is

1:30

this you can think of it as descendant of that I we wrote an NSF proposal to get one of every tool to make anything

1:36

of any size and that's roughly what they funded so Nano micro meso macro input

1:41

and output and that's what we use to do the kind of research I showed you scaling ahead there's about a thousand

1:48

cities uh the Whirlwind computer at MIT was transistorized at Lincoln Labs it

1:54

was commercialized as deck that was used to create the internet so this is um Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie at

2:00

Bell Labs inventing Unix and so if you have Android or iOS in your pocket you're using what they're doing in that

2:05

picture you're using the operating system from that picture and the analogy to that is Fab labs and the way I began

2:12

thinking about that is I had all these tools it would take a lifetime of classes to learn to use them so with

2:19

colleagues I started this class modestly called how to make almost anything that was aimed at just a few research students and I wasn't prepared for

2:25

hundreds of students to show up begging to get in saying all my life I've been waiting for this uh saying this seems

2:32

too useful are you allowed to teach it at MIT um and then what was surprising was what

2:37

they did um it was just to teach them the tools but they did projects to integrate them

2:42

so Kelly was a sculptor with no engineering background she made a device to save up screams and play him back later when it's convenient this is a web

2:50

browser Pirates have the cognitive ability of a young child that lets the parrots surf the Internet this is an

2:55

alarm clock you wrestle with and prove you're awake this is a dress with spines instrumented so if creepy guys show up

3:02

it protects your personal space and these happened year after year and I realized that I was asking how to do

3:09

digital fabrication but not why the students were answering the killer app of digital fabrication is personal

3:14

fabrication not mass manufacturing it's manufacturing for a market of one person

3:21

and so uh that led to this accident uh NSF told us we had gotten a lot of money

3:28

we have to tell people what we're doing uh we thought it was more interesting to

3:33

use the tools than talk about it so with a grand old man of community activism in Boston who recently passed away Mel King

3:40

we set up um a Fab Lab he pioneered Community cable tail division Community Computing

3:47

Community internet and inner city Boston and so it was a natural step to go from providing access technology to providing

3:54

the means to create it so instead of millions of dollars of machines these were the tools you need to do the how to

3:59

make class the 3D printer but the nine other tools you need to make complete functional systems so large format

4:05

Machining Precision Machining surface mount rework embedded programming Composites molding casting and with that

4:12

you can make all of this and we set up just one of them we thought we'd go back to the lab and go to work and what

4:17

happened was there's now 2500 and 125 countries they've every year and a half they've gone virally all around the

4:24

world we didn't plan that you can't wake up in Cambridge and decide rural India needs

4:30

these tools this is one with at-risk youth in Detroit this is bhutan's prime

4:35

minister where the country is based on gross national happiness but by crap bias crap trucked in from India this is

4:42

Holland Palestine Israeli boundary in uh Israel cooking the tribal council

4:48

amazing cultural traditions in Alaska NATO's terrible alcoholism suicide unemployment kids sit around playing

4:55

video games it connects digital technology with traditional craft a Protestant Catholic boundary in Northern

5:01

Ireland all we didn't plan that but every time we opened when somebody else wanted one providing access to the means

5:07

to make in all of these communities interestingly we helped a number of companies set up networks of them Airbus

5:14

de so GE Chevron they did they thought they were doing it as Outreach but more

5:20

knowledge was coming from the kids back into their Engineers That Was Then was going from the kids from the engineers

5:25

out to the kids so then I started we had Brighton event of kids in African Shanty towns in rural

5:32

Villages who would um be doing the work of my MIT classes and then fall off a cliff and be told you're smart you have

5:38

to go away so we started using this whole network as an educational platform

5:44

where instead of teaching a hundred students we teach a hundred Labs all around the world spanning from Elite

5:49

universities to these you know overdeveloped underdeveloped communities

5:54

and that led to things like this was a lab we ran at the White House in the Obama Administration this is a

6:00

Barcelona's mayor a fabulous design sense in Barcelona over 40 over 50 youth

6:07

unemployment a whole generation can't work effectively uh and so my colleague

6:13

Vicente gayart who is Gowdy's successor started investing in these Labs as Urban

6:18

infrastructure they described the city as a product to trash conversion device is how it currently functions they

6:25

instead want data to go in data to go the bits to come and go but the atoms to stay so they started investing in that

6:31

as Urban infrastructure that's grown into a Fab city commitment of Mexico City Paris cities all around the world

6:37

signing up not just to be smart but having means to make as Urban infrastructure so instead of jobs equals

6:43

work equals money equals consumption it's not Utopia it's not free but you change the notion of power and economy

6:50

functions by providing access to these tools and this is really interesting legislative in the House and Senate for universal

6:58

access to digital fabrication as a new kind of right that's really unusually bipartisan it spans red blue north south

7:05

sort of East-West all of those axes and for time I'll skip those

7:10

uh so that's where we are today these Fab La everything I just told you was an

7:16

accident we didn't plan any of that but in retrospect the Fab Lab is about two

7:22

tons it's about a hundred thousand dollars it fills a big room it's the cost and complexity of the mini computer

7:27

and like the mini computer it's being used to figure out the equivalent of the internet if anybody can make almost

7:34

anything anywhere how do you live learn work and play how do you we thought the technology was hard in many ways that's

7:40

easy what's hard is how it breaks traditional boundaries in education in industry in Aid in entertainment how you

7:48

how you catch up to the organizational structure for that so then from the PDP came the Altair

7:54

this prompted this was the first really personal computer this prompted The Homebrew Computer Club to meet that

8:01

became Apple it prompted the first software from micro Dash soft was written for this they eventually took

8:06

out the dash and became Microsoft that was the PC era and uh the birth of it and we're at the

8:14

scale of millions of towns and here the transition is for the Fab Labs we

8:20

started developing faster better cheaper tools so companies like form Labs or shaper tools or Fab light or Bantam or

8:27

handy bot uh with shopbot were all things that were spun out from making

8:32

faster better tools for Fab Labs but these weren't the point this was the

8:37

point the real point was not rapid prototyping it was rapid prototyping of

8:42

rapid prototyping so these are all Fab Lab tools made in Fab labs this is yens in Norway making large format tools this

8:49

is uh Danielle in Hamburg this is his laser cutter this is a beautiful precision machine from south of India

8:57

so these you don't go to the lab to get access to the tools you go to the lab to make the tools and to do that we've had

9:04

to revisit the boundaries between CAD cam machine control and motion control so one of the things

9:11

we do is a G-Code and anything like that is the enemy

9:16

because it enshrines a historical division of labor and if you want to change anything in the machine you need

9:22

to change the machine this configuration so instead what we do is we take the the

9:27

leaf nodes in the network every motor every actuator we connect them in

9:32

real-time networks and then we we build virtual data flow controllers over these real-time networks so the machine is

9:39

stateless it's similar to end-to-end principle in Internet architecture and then the

9:44

control the intelligence of the machine is distributed over it and so uh this community is worked mightily on

9:52

what comes after STL that needs to be done but I would argue what comes after

9:58

that is is nothing what comes after it is networks that we don't want stayed in

10:04

the machine you don't want assumptions about what the machine is you just want to expose the degrees of freedom

10:10

and allow geometry to talk to those degrees of freedom within that then lets

10:16

you do is rapidly change the configuration of the machine and it lets you control loops at many levels of

10:22

description and so I view better file formats as transitional what comes after that is just the machines are stateless

10:29

you expose the underlying degrees of freedom and you build virtual controllers over that and so uh this

10:36

paper is an example and there's Theses through CBA site on building those architecture so at this stage in the evolution then

10:43

we're doing things like this project we set up a number of these uh Fab labs in Bhutan a Fab Lab can make a machine but

10:51

it can't make most of the parts that go into the machine so we're deploying super Fab Labs that have tools closer to

10:57

what I have at MIT that can make not just the machine but the parts of the machine so this is bhutan's Prince doing

11:03

his first official function opening the lab but now there's things like this on flatbed cutter and the edms and the kind

11:10

of tools that let you make the parts of the machines uh one fun thing that spun

11:15

off from that is a haystack Mountain School of craft in Maine is a or the premier craft retreat in America where

11:23

the leading glass blowers and printmakers and blacksmiths and fiber artists Retreat and a few years ago we

11:30

set up a Fab Lab there it was initially very controversial uh I

11:35

describe it when Dylan went electric at Newport it was described as half of the audience was electrified the other half

11:41

was electrocuted and that was like that at Haystack half of the Crafters were

11:47

completely horrified we were bringing in technology and the other half were horrified at the first half not recognizing craft is full of technology

11:53

and there's good and bad technology then by the next year everybody forgot about

11:59

that and just fought about time on the laser cutter but the machines don't match well the

12:05

needs of the artist so now what we do every year is we take over the campus with artists and scientists and

12:11

engineers and instead of teaching them to use the machines we design machines for art we build a range of new sort of

12:16

machines to create and earlier today there's a mention of the nist materials genome initiative

12:22

we've been working very closely with that that's the national initiative on Advanced Materials but there's a problem

12:29

there's a big outer loop from developing a material to testing the material to modeling the material to

12:36

designing the material to learning to process the material to finally using the material so we started applying the

12:42

rapid machine building to Material Science with them Building open Material Science instrumentation and in

12:49

particular once the machines are stateless you can then start closing high-level control loops and so for

12:55

example making printers where we measure the forces and flows and then rather than doing reality offline to expand use

13:01

of recycled and renewable materials the printer builds computational materials as it's printing and it learns reality

13:08

uh online we've started to describe this for nist as as computational Metrology

13:14

so instead of measuring a parameter you measure computational models by closing

13:19

Loops in these machines and so to do all of that and for time I'm just skimming

13:24

in this tour with DARPA Jan vandenbrun who ran design at uh

13:30

simulation modeling at Boeing came to the conclusion those who were broke and he went to DARPA to reinvent design and

13:37

we worked with them on morphogenesis on propping propagating back into the design tools the implications of these

13:43

sort of machines what we did in that is it sort of tautological the design represents a

13:50

thing but your body doesn't do that nowhere in your body is the number of five for your fingers what your body

13:56

stores in one of the oldest parts of the genome is a developmental program at the end of which you have five fingers and

14:03

it does it for a very fundamental AI reason which is most changes in the genome are fatal or inconsequential but

14:10

not interesting in these Hox genes these developmental programs are a basis where

14:16

search is interesting and so in this project we looked at how to represent design through developmental programs

14:21

not as explicit representation of the geometry that in turn was limited by the

14:27

physics engines in this DARPA program we filled in the space between molecular Dynamics and pde solvers with universal

14:35

particle systems to make mesh-free modeling of complex geometry and papers in all of those

14:43

so uh to keep scaling there's billions of people on Earth billions is now the

14:49

smartphone era and to look at that

14:55

this whole meeting you have without really thinking about it has has been analog

15:02

uh nothing has changed from what I've heard so far and it's

15:07

true almost everywhere from the 1952 NC Mill where the computer controls the

15:12

milling machine what's changed is you might deposit versus cut but the information is in the computer not in

15:18

the material it's fundamentally analog now consider a child playing with Lego bricks when you play with Lego bricks

15:26

the tower is more accurate than the motor control of the child because you can detect in errors uh in the

15:33

construction rather than accumulating them you don't need a ruler to play with Lego because the geometry comes from the

15:38

parts you can join Lego bricks made out of dissimilar materials and there's no

15:43

trash in a Lego playroom you can disassemble because the parts contain enough information to not just assemble

15:50

them but disassemble them so that's fundamentally a digital process

15:55

and that idea isn't new Shannon showed how to

16:01

communicate reliably with an unreliable Communication channel Von Neumann applied that to Computing reliably with

16:08

an unreliable Computing system and there's very interesting history for

16:13

how that came about and that's all based on threshold theorems digital isn't one

16:19

and zero digital is a scaling property if the noise is above a threshold you're doomed if the noise is below the

16:25

threshold for a linear increase in physical resources the error goes down exponentially and there's very few

16:31

exponentials in engineering so that's digital communication and computation and that led me to be interested in this

16:37

idea of digital materials that are digital not in the design but in the construction so discrete sets of Parts

16:44

reversibly joined with local geometry giving Global constraints so one of the

16:50

first places we did that I was approached by spirit arrow Boeing's factories about the problem of how you

16:56

glue together big composite Parts which are vulnerable vulnerability in the Composites and they wanted a better way

17:02

to glue them together and what it led us to realize is rather than eliminating joints we should make joints everywhere

17:08

we showed by linking Loops of carbon fiber you make an effective metamaterial

17:14

that increased the modulus and the ultralight by an order of magnitude uh with making macroscopic not tiny

17:21

research samples in a purely reversible process then here we showed starting from the same base material that's rigid

17:28

that's flexural that's oxidic that's chiral we can design very anisotropic material properties just by composing

17:34

those couple building blocks we use this with NASA this is Langley's

17:39

biggest wind tunnel to realize a long-standing goal a purely morphing Arrow structures not by building a

17:46

mechanism into it but by effectively turning it into a mechanism this was a high efficiency race car with

17:52

Toyota where instead of a year of tooling it was done with a direct rate assembly process

17:58

MIT years ago made robotuna this amazing swimming robot that had thousands of

18:04

Parts this was in effect not quite but almost an afternoon process to make a high efficiency swimming robot out of

18:10

these very anisotropic structures this is load bearing in One Direction soft in another Direction by the code of how

18:16

they're assembled and then the discretization of these parts propagates in a very interesting

18:22

way to how you build with them these are little robots that locomote on the structure to navigate they error correct

18:30

on the structure and then by doing local operations they can build globally on the structure and so it's really a kind

18:36

of a hybrid material robot system you don't need a Gantry to make a big thing you need these little robots to make a

18:42

big thing and what we're about to write something up on to reach the material strength limits we've been doing this in

18:48

metal plate lattices and so this is an offshoot an art installation from the

18:54

design in the metal plate lattices this this ball is about 10 feet tall and a fun detail is was about five hours from

19:00

sheet stock to being finished in this kind of assembly process

19:06

so that's all promising so then uh there are trillions of things on earth in The

19:13

Internet of Things era The Nest Thermostat not metaphorically but literally has the power of the PDP

19:19

computer and here there's a scaling issue so you've heard a lot about AI today if you

19:25

look at the numbers uh as of about a a year or two ago a

19:31

supercomputer could do 10 to the 17 Ops per second and a brain could do 10 to the 17 Ops per second and so the real

19:37

thing that's happened isn't a breakthrough in the algorithms it's really just the scaling we've caught up

19:43

to brains and we'd be sort of derelict if it couldn't roughly do what a brain does uh the you know the exascale

19:50

computer has 10 to the 15 transistors the petabyte storage is 10 to the 16 which is about the order of the number

19:55

of synapses so the real threshold is just the computational complexity matches the brain but if you look at the

20:03

Fab making the supercomputer it's doing about 10 to the 10 parts per second you

20:09

as you sit there digesting your lunch you're doing 10 to the 18 parts per second so there's eight orders of

20:14

magnitude in fabricational complexity in sort of molecular intelligence so the

20:20

insight there is a little earlier it's four billion years ago old that's the evolutionary age of the ribosome and the

20:27

key inside one of the key insights of the ribosome is ribosomes make ribosomes

20:33

so a ribosome is slow it adds one amino acid a second but you can make an elephant one amino acid a second because

20:39

a cell can have trillions of ribosomes and then um uh that adds up to this enormous

20:46

throughput this this 10 to the 18 parts per second comes from the recursion of ribosomes making ribosomes the other

20:53

Insight is digikey stocks hundreds of thousands of electronic part types

20:58

you're based on just 20 the amino acids and what's interesting is they're not

21:03

interesting that they're just typical they're hydrophobic or hydrophilic or basic or acidic but that's enough to

21:09

compose them to make the molecular Machinery that makes you possible so you can design with them these are projects

21:15

we did designing with that basis set but you're limited to the material properties of molecular biology

21:22

so in molecular biology the coding sequence becomes geometrical motifs that

21:28

become building blocks like electron donors or acceptors that then become molecular machines like the ribosome so

21:35

that's primary secondary tertiary quaternary structure and that led me to think about why can't we do that with

21:42

engineered materials so why can't we in effect reproduce life from non-living materials but instead of having a code

21:49

describe a thing reproduce this idea of the code becoming the thing and so this

21:55

was a paper where we took the robotic assemblers I showed you and then I'll just show you the design tool we showed

22:01

how the robot can make the robot so making by making the robot out of the parts it's assembling

22:08

the robot can locomote on the structure but it can take a feedstock of the parts

22:15

and assemble another robot

22:27

and then that robot wakes up and can build another robot and it leads to a really interesting design problem of a

22:33

robot can build a thing it can build another robot or it can build a bigger robot and so in in this paper in this

22:40

paper we talk about that design problem uh so then from there uh this is a micro

22:47

assembler and what the micro assembler is doing is it's Building electromechanical Systems

22:53

so it's placing rigid flexural magnetic inductive parts and one part is rigid

22:59

two is parallel transport four of them becomes a four bar linkage uh one

23:04

magnetic bit is one bit two becomes cyclical motion then it becomes micro Motors and then you can make locomoting

23:11

micro robots and so that builds the electromechanical systems and then these

23:17

are machines we're making that are across between a pick and place and a 3D printer and they assemble the

23:23

construction of the computation of the intelligence in the systems so so they construct there's a traditional division

23:30

between software and Hardware but here we're compiling the computation into its construction by building these

23:36

computational building blocks and so that leads to this hierarchy from these base just fundamentally discrete

23:44

materials and I'd say the the the the the the two message first message from today is kill off file formats and

23:51

replace them with networks and the second one is the really interesting transition isn't analog is an additive

23:57

versus subtractive the really interesting one hasn't happened yet it's it's assembly and disassembly it's it's

24:03

it's the discretization the digitization and that's every bit as profound in construction as it is in communication

24:10

and computation uh it's a as a footnote uh I was at Bell

24:16

labs and I overlapped at the very end of people who had been around when Shannon was there and they explained when

24:21

Shannon came and explained why the phone system should be digital there's a lot of fighting over analog versus digital

24:26

in the phone system and uh from Bob lucky I learned one of the greatest

24:31

management lessons he explained the battle was won by Death that that the analog managers died and

24:38

then the phone system became digital uh but so there's this hierarchy of the

24:44

discrete Parts make the micro mechanical systems that build the micro robots that build parts that build the bigger robots

24:50

on through the stack and so I've shown you examples of work at each of that scales now

24:56

I started the talk by complaining about computer science as being unphysical but

25:03

the Canon of computer science sort of misses the origins of computer science so John Von Neumann did not

25:10

write beautifully about the Von Neumann architecture it's in one Dreadful memo but he wrote beautifully about

25:17

profoundly about a number of things and at the end of his life he studied self-reproducing automata how a

25:23

computation communicates its own construction and he did that to get it the heart of what is life

25:30

turing's machine was never meant to be a computer architecture and in effect it turned into one it makes a fundamental

25:36

physical mistake the head is distinct from the tape so Persistence of state is distinct from interaction which is why

25:43

this computer spends so much time moving data from memory transistors to processor transistors that have the same

25:50

computational power but he ended his life studying morphogenesis the profound question of how genes give rise to form

25:56

so the foundation the founders of computing ended their life studying

26:03

computational design from fabrication but but they did it not as the song the

26:09

software is in the machine and the Machine is analog they did it in this much more profound sense of how you

26:15

merge communication computation and Fabrication so the description becomes the thing in morphogenesis and

26:22

self-reproducing systems that that those were the ideas somewhat forgotten at the beginning of

26:27

computing we're now at a point where you can really do them experimentally one way to see what that'll look like is I

26:33

was science advisor on a Big Hero 6 and so we were doing inflatable robots but

26:38

we're doing these micro robots and so the micro robots in Big Hero 6 is one version of what that looks like a more

26:44

serious one is this is a program we did for bonus material for the movie The Martian where we're looking at how do

26:51

you actually build a civilization on Mars and what's called isru in situ

26:56

resource utilization historically is assumed you need to do the whole Industrial Revolution you need digikey

27:02

with a hundred thousand resistors you should at this point recognize the kind of pictures behind me what's emerging is

27:08

you essentially want to create life in non-living materials you want the analogues to amino acids you need these

27:14

20 material properties you can hierarchically compose or if you want to look at the data

27:20

uh this is time this is Gordon Moore's initial data points that led him to

27:26

forecast Moore's Law This Is 50 years of Moore's Law scaling and then this is uh

27:32

10 years of the Fab Lab spread as one measure of digital fabrication this

27:38

shows the exponential growth of digital fabrication and there's actually more data here than

27:44

Gordon Moore had and so uh it it just the data it's rational to project 50

27:51

years of scaling of digital fabrication and then I've walked you through steps

27:57

from uh machines making machines to providing access to the machines to

28:02

rapid prototyping of the machines to assemblers to self-assemblers and I'll

28:07

end with when I talk about this people clap and say that sounds exciting my younger brother led the biggest video

28:13

game Studio at Activision my older brother led the national liberal relations organization and they would

28:19

both be in the back groaning um seeing that I'm being naive about how

28:25

technology comes in society so the libertarian vision for the birth of the internet didn't anticipate spam and fake

28:31

news and income inequality and all the problems we're struggling with and so we wrote this book for me to describe this

28:37

road map to the replicator that's not happening in series it's hap sort of all these steps I showed you are in the lab

28:43

but they're coming out between now and decades in the future but what the book is about is to anticipate barriers to

28:50

access inequality literacies rather than waiting for it to go wrong in 50 years

28:55

how we can really take seriously the scaling and shape this revolution today so the skills of this community are

29:02

absolutely essential and I want to leave you with thinking about not just file formats but closing higher and higher

29:08

control loops with machines is real-time networks thinking about how as this goes

29:15

out into society it's not just products for consumption but chasing the notion of how the economy functions

29:20

and ultimately about this transition not from subtractive to additive but analog

29:26

to digital in the materials themselves it's late I won't take questions I'll be happy to discuss at the reception thank

29:32

you [Applause]

29:43

thank you so much I really appreciate your Insight there and all we can look forward to and I can I have one question

29:50

if we have these uh the ability to make self-assembling robots how do we design

29:55

them and how do we design what they make it okay

30:05

so yeah there are a bunch of levels to it um uh one step in is we're doing work

30:14

echoing some things you heard today about there's this gulf between uh

30:20

generative design over here and Decades of work on Geometry engines so just connecting constraints with generative

30:27

design is a valley and like a number of groups were working on helping fill that in as one step

30:33

uh then the second step is what I showed very briefly about morphogenesis in

30:39

design and um the particle system simulation is to

30:44

do a lot of what I showed you just today we break we work closely with groups like

30:49

um Autodesk and uh deso systems and SolidWorks and

30:54

um we break all of their design tools and we break all of their simulation tools so we have to end up writing a lot

31:00

of our own tools to be able to do that and handling that complexity is what leads to things like I was

31:08

describing about morphogenesis and particle system simulation which if you're interested in the reception I can

31:14

tell you more about why we do those things but um

31:19

ultimately I'll give you the Deep answer and then the Practical answer the Deep answer is uh Evolution doesn't do what

31:27

most people think that's what I was alluding to with the Hox genes Evolution doesn't randomly perturb it it the heart

31:35

of AI in part is just computational complexity but a big part of it is in a high

31:43

dimensional space uh search in a random direction is guaranteed to not find a

31:48

low dimensional sub manifold and the the heart of AI is parameterizing a low dimensional part of a high dimensional

31:55

space and that's what the genome does that that's what the the Hox genes these

32:00

developmental programs do they parameterize a search space where you can go from walking to swimming to

32:06

flying um rather than randomly perturbing in the high dimensional space and so what

32:13

we're inching towards is learning how to build not naive Evolution but real

32:18

evolution in these systems initially offline with these High Fidelity simulation engines I described but

32:24

moving that online's in the system so Evolution not as random search but

32:29

really Evolution deeply grounded but um a big part of what I would say for

32:35

the answer is uh if you look at the the thousand million billion trillion

32:40

scaling uh on the mini computer you could do everything you could do today

32:47

with the smartphone but it filled the room and cost a hundred thousand dollars

32:52

in the same sense you can already make almost anything in a Fab Lab today but you still need a global supply chain uh

32:59

to Source it year by year it's going to get faster better cheaper easier more

33:04

automated but to a surprising extent you can do it today and

33:10

I I thought things like how do you do design in these was hard what really drives it is the the wisdom of people

33:18

and so um you know uh um a big part of this Global scaling is

33:25

not machine intelligence it's human intelligence it it it's it's providing

33:31

the tools in ways that you build on the wisdom of all of these communities so you know the Deep answer is in a deep

33:37

way understanding how Evolution works but a big part of the Practical answer is moving design is something done by

33:45

Specialists for everybody else to empowering everybody to do it
