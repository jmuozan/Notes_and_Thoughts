## Checkpoint Questions

- ### ***What am I really focusing on right now, and is it still what I set out to explore?***

I'm trying to understand how craftsmanship survives in our digital world. It's not about saving old techniques, but about keeping the soul of making things alive. *Can technology help?*

- ### ***Has anything Iâ€™ve read or discovered recently changed how I see this topic?***

I've been revisiting Arts&Crafts and When Thinks Strat to Thonk recently. On the first one was interesting to relate Gershenfelkds work in Fab to William Morris vision who looked to maintain the dignity of crafts by conecting the "artisan" to the creation.



- ### ***What new questions or ideas have popped up, and how do they connect to what I already know?***


Based on the previous question, it's interesting to think that maybe fablabs act as preservation tools themselves, ***Aren't thewy in a way preserving the creative the creative agency of individuals?***

- ### ***Looking back at my past answers, do I notice any shifts in my thinking or patterns in how I approach this?***

Not really, mainly an expension of what preserving really means
