## Checkpoint Questions

- ### ***What am I really focusing on right now, and is it still what I set out to explore?***

I'm currently focusing on the preservation aspect of the crafts. What it means to preserve the crafts? Are current preserving methods obsolete? 
It's been drifting a bit. In december I was exploring how Digital Fabroication could intervene in the crafts processes
- ### ***Has anything Iâ€™ve read or discovered recently changed how I see this topic?***

With my revisit of FAB, I've been rethinking certain aspects around preservation.
***If, thanks to the "democratization" of personal fabrication, objects can be "perfectly" reproduced from digital files, what constitutes the "original"?*** ***Is it the physical artifact, the digital design, or the creative process itself?*** 
Maybe preservation as we knoe should evolve. maybe keeping a digital copy is not worth it anymore, we might instead need to preserve the conditions that enable ongoing creation and reinvention. I personally find this related to the "Fab movement", Fablabs have helped establish around the world represent not just access to digital fabrication tools but the preservation of creative agency itself.

- ### ***What new questions or ideas have popped up, and how do they connect to what I already know?***

***If, as Sennett argues, it is the obstacles and resistances encountered that develop artisanal practice and understanding, shouldn't we focus our efforts on preserving this process of obstacles and resistance rather than the technique itself?***

- ### ***Looking back at my past answers, do I notice any shifts in my thinking or patterns in how I approach this?***
