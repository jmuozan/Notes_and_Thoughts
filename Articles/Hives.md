## What does this article talk about

The autor of the book _Hives_, Aladin Borioli, gives this interview where he explains the sense of his book. _Why would it be interesting to maintain a repository of the evolution and iteration of the beehive throughout history?_ The beehives, having been made of fragile materials throughout history, haven't been conserved well, plus the little interest, in words of the autor, that exists for them. The autor, being a beekeper himself, decided to preserve these works and their knowledge in a book that would fit into a pocket.

## Insights

Personally, I find it interesting to highlight the following quote from the autor:

> **"There isn't much interest in the subject of beehives, by way of research and academia."**
> 
> Gorny, L. (2022). _Archiving beehives through the ages, Hives opens the lid on our ancient relationship with the species_. It's Nice That.

This reflection despite being able to pass unnoticed makes me ask myself the following questions:

- _**Why doesn't exist an interest in "rescuing" and preserving through investigation a type of craftwork?**_

- _**Would this perception be had if it was about what we conceive as "art" and not craftwork?

- _**Is this perception of the autor simply a reflection of the division and confrontation between art and craftwork that started during the Renaissance?**_

This lack of interest has deep historical roots. During the Renaissance, a fundamental shift occurred in how society valued different forms of knowledge and creation. The "liberal arts" (including geometry, rhetoric, logic) were elevated as intellectual pursuits worthy of the educated elite, while the "illiberal arts" of making physical objects were demoted to utilitarian, commercial endeavors.

As Neil Gershenfeld exposed during the chapter 'The Past' in his book *Fab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication* during the Renaissance period, the act of 'making' was identified as art just pursued for economical reasons, as seen by the the noble class, it was art without a message, just a purpose.

>**"Unfortunately, the ability to make things as well as ideas didn't make the cut; that was relegated to the artes illiberales, the 'illiberal arts,' that one pursued for mere economic gain. With art separated from artisans, the remaining fabrication skills were considered just mechanical production."**
>Gershenfeld, N. (2007). _Fab: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--from Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication_. Basic Books.

This created an enduring bias in academic and cultural institutions. Museums, universities, and scholarly journals emerged with distinct departments for "fine arts" but rarely for "craft." For this reason, funding, preservation efforts, and scholarly attention naturally have seemed to flow towards what has been told to be culturally significant. Crafts like in this case beehive-making have fallen into a blind spot, mostly considered neither historically significant nor aesthetically valuable enough to warrant systematic preservation.


As a second point to highlight, it also seems important to focus on the following quote:

> **"_photography is nowhere near as old as a beehive_"**
> 
> Gorny, L. (2022). _Archiving beehives through the ages, Hives opens the lid on our ancient relationship with the species_. It's Nice That.

Which I consider raises a new question:

- _**How can we make use of "emerging" technologies to preserve art and craftwork?**_

If the goal is to preserve, restore and conserve the crafts in the 4th (or 5th) digital revolution the methods used should be in line with what's offered.
