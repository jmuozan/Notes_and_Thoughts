Rodríguez cut a 1954 Jeep in half, extended it nearly 18 inches, added Soviet-era Volga steering, and plans to get it running with a used 1994 Jetta engine — an engine already attached to a Hyundai transmission.


### Preservation Through Adaptation vs. Replication
Cuban mechanics are preserving automotive heritage not through museum-style conservation, but through practical problem-solving and creative adaptation. They're not documenting and replicating; they're evolving and extending.

## Resource Constraints as Drivers of Innovation

Cuban mechanics developed their hybrid approach due to trade embargoes and economic limitations. These constraints forced creative solutions and a deep understanding of mechanical principles rather than reliance on replacement parts.

Similarly, traditional craftspeople often developed techniques based on local material availability and limitations.

## Neo-Craftsmanship and Cuban "Neo-Automotive"

The Cuban auto mechanic culture represents a form of "neo-automotive" practice where traditional vehicles are maintained through contemporary means and hybrid approaches.
