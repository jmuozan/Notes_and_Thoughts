>What is AI? A dominant view describes it as the quest ‘to solve intelligence’ – a solution supposedly to be found in the secret logic of the mind or in the deep physiology of the brain, such as in its complex neural networks. In this book I argue, to the contrary, that the inner code of AI is constituted not by the imitation of biological intelligence but by the intelligence of labour and social relations. Today, it should be evident that AI is a project to capture the knowledge expressed through individual and collective behaviours and encode it into algorithmic models to automate the most diverse tasks: from image recognition and object manipulation to language translation and decision-making. As in a typical effect of ideology, the ‘solution’ to the enigma of AI is in front of our eyes, but nobody can see it – nor does anybody want to.



**To what extent can making be automated?? More interestingly, should it be a goal of ours to do it?**

**How do we know (and meassure) AI learns appropriately?**


>If the skill of driving can be translated into an algorithmic model to begin with, it is because driving is a logical activity – because, ultimately, all labour is logic



>Taylor understood the Babbage principle better than anyone of his time, and it was always uppermost in his calculations.’12 In order to surveil the worker’s smallest gesture, the Taylorist system even acquired cinematographic eyes: the factory’s master became a sort of movie director who filmed workers in order to measure and optimize their productivity, somehow realising what media scholar Jon Beller has termed the ‘cinematic mode of production’.


>the ‘intelligence’ of technological innovation has often originated from the imitation of these abstract diagrams of human praxis and collective behaviours.


>workers are needed (and always will be) to produce data and value for the voracious pipelines of AI and its global monopolies, and, on the other hand, to provide the maintenance of such a mega-machine under the form of content filtering, security checks, evaluation and non-stop optimisation.

>Speculative narratives aside, which never go into sufficient technical detail to clarify which kind of algorithms would actually execute ‘superintelligence’, one also finds today numerous technical histories of AI that, on the other hand, promise to explain its complex algorithms.25 These technical overviews often voice corporate expectations for a ‘master algorithm’ that would solve all tasks of perception and cognition at a prodigious rate of information compression (because this is the very unromantic metrics by which ‘intelligent’ systems are ultimately assessed)


>In all these genealogies, the automation of labour has been the key factor, but this aspect is often neglected by a historiography of technology that privileges science’s point of view ‘from above’


***algorithms have existed since the beginning of time and existed long before a special word was coined to describe them***
