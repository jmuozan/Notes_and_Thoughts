>In almost all cases there's no sympathy between the designer and the man who carries out the design; not unseldom the designer is also driven to work in a mechanical, down-hearted kind of way, and I don't wonder at it. I know by experience that the making of design after design - mere diagrams, mind you- without oneself executing them, is a great strain upon the mind. It is necessary, unless all work men of all grades are to be permanently degraded into machines, that the hand should rest the mind as well as the mind the hand. And I say that this is the kind of work which the world has lost, supplying its pace with the work which is the division of labour. That work ,whatever else it can do, it cannot produce art, which must, as long as the present system lasts, be entirely confined to such works as are the work from begining to end of one man: pictures, independent sculpture, and the like. As to these, on the one hand, they cannot fill the gap which the loss of popular art has made, nor can they, especially, the most imaginative of them, recieve the sympathy which should be their due. 



>What then? Machines then. Truly we shall have a good stock to start with, but not near enough. Some men must press on to martyrdom, and toil to invent new ones, till at last pretty nearly everything that is necessary to men will be made by machines. i don't see why it should not be done. I myself have boundless faith in their capacity. I believe machines can do everything -except works of art.
>And yet again, what next? sUPPOSING WE SHALL BE ABLE TO GET MARTYRS ENOUGH (or say slaves) to make all the machines that will still be needed, and and to work them, shall we still be able to get rid of all albour, of all that which we have found ot is an unmitigated curse? And what will our conscienes be like (since I started by supposing us all to be conscientious people), when we think we have done all that we can do,

>worked mightily before you is an incentive for you to work faithfully now, that you may leave something to those who come after you.
What next is to be thought of after education? I here admit that if you accept art and join the ranks of those who are to rise in rebellion against the Philistines, you will have a roughish time of it. "Nothing for nothing and no luck," says a Yankee somewhere, and I am sorry to say it is the rule of nature also. Those of us who have money will have to give time, and thought, and the cause, and all of us will have to give time, and thought, and trouble to it; and I must now consider a matter of the utmost importance to art and to the lives of all of us, which we can, if we please, deal with at once, but which emphatically claims of us time, thought, and money. Of all the things that is likely to give us back popular necessity, the cleaning of England is the first and most necessary. Those who are to make beautiful things must live in a beautiful place.
Some people may be inclined to say, and I have heard the argument put forward, that the very opposition between the serenity and purity of art and the turmoil and squalor of a great modern city stimulates the invention of artists, and produces special life in the art of today. I cannot believe it. It seems to me that at best it but stimulates the feverish and dreamy qualities that throw some artists out of the general sympathy. But apart from that, these are men who are stuffed with memories of more romantic days and pleasanter lands, and it is on these memories they live, to my mind not altogether happily for their art; and you see it is only a very few men who could have even these doubtful advantages.
I abide by my statement that those who are to make beautiful things must live in beautiful places, but you must understand I do not mean to claim for all craftsmen a share of those gardens of the world, or of those sublime and awe-inspiring mountains and wastes that men make pilgrimages

>globos y construyendo castillos de arena con todo ese esfuerzo que hemos hecho fundando escuelas de arte, Galerías Nacionales, museos en South Kensington y todo lo demás. He dicho que la educación es buena, y necesaria, para todo el mundo; incluso si quisieran no podrían impedirla; y sin embargo educar a la gente sin esperanza, qué cabe esperar que resulte de eso? Tal vez Rusia nos sirva de ejemplo de lo que puede suceder.
Mirad, cuando me siento a trabajar en casa, que está en Hammersmith, junto al río, a menudo oigo por mi ventana alguna villanía de las que se escribe últimamente en los periódicos y de las que en el pasado se ha hablado de cuándo en cuándo.
Oír los gritos e improperios y la vileza expresada en la admirable lengua de Shakespeare y Milton, ver las caras brutales e insensatas que desfilan ante mí, también despierta en mí la brutalidad y la insensatez y siento que me domina la hora feroz hasta que recuerdo, creo la mayoría de las veces, que sólo la gran suerte de haber nacido respetable y rico me ha colocado a este lado de la ventana entre maravillosos libros y admirables obras de arte, y no de la otra parte, en la calle vacía, en las tiendas atestadas de licores y bebidas, en alojamientos sucios y miserables. ¿Qué palabras pueden expresar lo que todo eso significa?
No penséis, o lo ruego, que hablo de manera retorica cuanto digo que, con respecto a estas cosas, lo que más deseo es que este gran país se libere de todos sus enredos extranjeros y coloniales, y dirija esa fuerza poderosa de su gente respetable, el poder más grande que haya visto el mundo nunca, para dar a los hijos de esa pobre gente los placeres y las esperanzas de los hombres. ¿Es eso realmente imposible? ¿No hay esperanza de alcanzar eso?
Si es así, solo puedo decir que la civilización es un engaño y una falacia; no existe tal cosa y no hay esperanza.
Pero puesto que deseo vivir e incluso ser feliz, me niego a pensar que es imposible. Sé por mis propios sentimientos y deseos lo que les libraría del más profundo salvajismo: un empleo que reforzaría su autoestima y les brindaría el aprecio y afecto de sus congéneres, una vivienda

>and must still be waited upon by groaning, discontented wretches. What shall we do, I say?
Well, I must say that my imagination will stretch no further than to suggest rebellion in general as a remedy, the end of which rebellion, if successful, must needs be to set up some form of art again as a necessary solace of mankind.
But to say the truth, this leads me to making another suggestion, a practical one. I consider it. Suppose we start by rebelleing at once; because when I spoke of the world having to choose between accepting and rejecting art, I did not suppose that its choice could be final if it chose to reject it.
No, the rebellion will have to come and will be victorious, don't doubt that; only if we wait till the tyranny is firmly established, our rebellion will have to be a Nihilistic one; every help would be gone save deadly anger and the hope that comes of despair; whereas if we begin now, the change and the counter-change will work together, and the new art will come upon us gradually, and we shall one day see it marching on steadily and victoriously, though its battle has raised no clamour—we, or our sons, or our sons' sons.
How shall our rebellion begin then? What is the remedy for the lack of due pleasure in their work which has befallen all craftsmen, and for the consequent sickness of art and degradation of civilization?
I am afraid whatever answer I may make to that question will disappoint you. I myself suffer so sorely from the lack above-mentioned that I have little remedy in myself save that of fostering discontent. I have no infallible nostrum to cure an evil whose growth is centuries old. Any remedies I can think of are commonplace enough. In those old days of popular art, the world, in spite of all the ills that beset life, was struggling toward civilization and liberty, and it is in that way which we must also struggle, unless you think that we are civilized enough already, as I must confess I do not. Education on all sides is what we must look to. We may expect, if we


>vagueness. Always think your design out in your head before you begin to get it on the paper. Don't begin by slobbering and messing about in the hope that something will come out of it. You must see it before you can draw it, be sure that you can draw it, can draw indeed, from your own invention or Nature's, its form, colour, and outline, silhouette, before modelling; not because these latter are of less importance, but because they can't be right if the first are wrong.
Now, upon all these points you may be as severe with yourselves as you will, and are not likely to be too severe. Furthermore, those of you especially for goods, try to get the most out of your material, always in such a way as honours it most. Not only should it be obvious what your material is, but something that could not be done with any other. This is the very raison d'être of decorative art: to make stone look like stone work, or wood like silk, or pottery like stone is not the last resource of decrepitude of art. Set yourselves as much as possible against all machine-work (this to all men). But if you have to design for machine-work, clearly design what it is. Make it mechanical with a vengeance, at the same time as simple as possible. Make it so that it can look like a printed plate look like a hand-painted one: make it by hand, if your market drives you into printed plates: by hand, if your market drives you into printed plates; I don't see the use of them myself.
To sum up, don't let yourselves be made machines, or it is all up with you as artists. Though I don't much love the iron and base machines, the flesh and blood ones are more terrible and hopeless to me; no man is so clumsy or base a workman that he is not fit for something better than that.
Well, I have said that education is the first remedy for the barbarism which has been bred by the hurry of civilization and competitive commerce. To know that men lived and

>do not learn much, to learn this at least, that we know but little, and that knowledge means aspiration of discontent, call it which you will.
I do not doubt that, as far as our schools of art go, education is bringing us to that point. I do not think any reasonable man can consider them a failure when the condition of the ornamental part of the individual arts is considered at the time of their foundation. True it is that those who established them were partly influenced by a delusive expectation that they would presently be able to supply directly a demand which was felt for trained and skilful designers of goods; but, though this hope failed them, they have no doubt influenced both that side of art and others also; among all that they have done not the least is that public recognition of the value of art in general, which their very existence implies: or, to speak more correctly, their existence and the interest is felt in them, is a token of people's uneasiness as the present disorganized state of the arts.
Perhaps you who study here, and represent such a large body of people who must needs have some aspirations towards the progress of the arts, will excuse a word or two from me a little less general than the rest I have been saying. I think I have a right to look upon you as enrolled soldiers of that rebellion against blank ugliness that I have been preaching this evening. You, therefore, above all people are bound to be careful not to give cause to the enemy to blaspheme. You are bound to be especially careful to do solid, genuine work, and eschew all pretence and flashiness.
Be sure to eschew all vagueness. It is better to be caught out in going wrong when you have had a definite purpose, than to shuffle and slur so that people can't blame you because they don't know what you are at. Hold fast to distinct form in art. Don't think too much of style, but set yourself to get out of you what you think beautiful, and express it, as cautiously as you please, but, I repeat, quite distinctly and without
