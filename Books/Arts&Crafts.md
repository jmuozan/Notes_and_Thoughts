>In almost all cases there's no sympathy between the designer and the man who carries out the design; not unseldom the designer is also driven to work in a mechanical, down-hearted kind of way, and I don't wonder at it. I know by experience that the making of design after design - mere diagrams, mind you- without oneself executing them, is a great strain upon the mind. It is necessary, unless all work men of all grades are to be permanently degraded into machines, that the hand should rest the mind as well as the mind the hand. And I say that this is the kind of work which the world has lost, supplying its pace with the work which is the division of labour. That work ,whatever else it can do, it cannot produce art, which must, as long as the present system lasts, be entirely confined to such works as are the work from begining to end of one man: pictures, independent sculpture, and the like. As to these, on the one hand, they cannot fill the gap which the loss of popular art has made, nor can they, especially, the most imaginative of them, recieve the sympathy which should be their due. 



>What then? Machines then. Truly we shall have a good stock to start with, but not near enough. Some men must press on to martyrdom, and toil to invent new ones, till at last pretty nearly everything that is necessary to men will be made by machines. i don't see why it should not be done. I myself have boundless faith in their capacity. I believe machines can do everything -except works of art.
>And yet again, what next? sUPPOSING WE SHALL BE ABLE TO GET MARTYRS ENOUGH (or say slaves) to make all the machines that will still be needed, and and to work them, shall we still be able to get rid of all albour, of all that which we have found ot is an unmitigated curse? And what will our conscienes be like (since I started by supposing us all to be conscientious people), when we think we have done all that we can do,
