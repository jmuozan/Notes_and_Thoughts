### The * *Rifirafe*
The historical rupture between art and craft, initiated during the Renaissance and deepened by the Industrial Revolution, has left a mark on how we perceive, value, and preserve human creative expression. As Gershenfeld mentions in the book, this artificial division relegated fabrication to what we know as "illiberal arts" pursued merely for economic gain. This intellectual bifurcation has had consequences that extend beyond academic categorization into the root of how our societies operate, organize labor, and determine which forms of creativity deserve preservation.

>The Renaissance prioritized intellectual pursuits over manual skills, elevating the "liberal arts" while diminishing the value of the crafts. This division was neither natural nor inevitable, but rather a conscious restructuring of knowledge hierarchies. 

This division culminated in what Gershenfeld identifies as "the invention of unskilled labor in the Industrial Revolution." When Jacquard introduced his programmable loom in 1801, weavers were reduced from skilled artisans to machine operators, with Lyon's silk weavers destroying Jacquard's looms in protest, even though they lost the fight against the industrialization of their sector, thwey represent what was truly at stake: not just jobs, but the dignity and meaning found in skilled creative work.

### From Mass production to Personal Expression (The Present)

As a reaction against industrialization and mass production, with the goal to restore the value of handcrafted objects the Arts&Crafts movement emerged, with William Morris as the maximum exponent of it. Him and his collaborators established as a collective with the goal of reviving the essence and quality of medieval craftsmanship through handcrafted objects. Reclaiming the value of manual work against the dehumanization of industrialization.

De la misma manera que Morris cuestionó la deshumanización que trajo consigo la industrialización, Neil Gershenfeld, describió un movimiento moderno similar, pero que, a diferencia del movimiento Arts&Crafts, se empoderaba para enfrentar esta deshumanización ***A TRAVÉS*** de la tecnología en lugar de rechazarla. El movimiento, basado en el empoderamiento de los usuarios mediante el uso de herramientas de fabricación digital con el objetivo de aprender "how to make almost anything" , en palabras del autor, ***"really represents a return to our industrial roots, before art was separated from artisans, when production was done for individuals rather than masses."*** Personal fabrication puts ***"control of the creation of technology back in the hands of its users."*** 

This last aspect represents the same way that traditionally, artisans had control over their creative process. This vision establishes a conceptual bridge between Morris's artisanal philosophy and modern digital fabrication, demonstrating that both movements, although separated by time and technology, share fundamental values regarding creative autonomy and personalization.

> At that time, neither Watt nor Morris could combine their work along the same line; even if it diverged in some way, any approach was impossible, let alone thinking that technology and craftsmanship could coexist toward a common result benefiting both. Morris was the antithesis of industrialized progress and even used politics as a means to defend his ideals.

This quote reflects the historical dichotomy between technology and craftsmanship, a conflict that seemed irreconcilable in Morris's time. However, the contemporary perspective offered by Gershenfeld invites us to reconsider this apparent incompatibility. Where Morris saw a threat in industrialization, Gershenfeld finds an opportunity to democratize creation through digital technology, thus achieving a conceptual synthesis that would have been unthinkable in the 19th century.

The "Arts and Crafts" Movement reminds us of the importance of integrating creativity and artisanal uniqueness into our technological world, promoting development that balances innovation with cultural heritage. The challenge is not to choose between technology or tradition, but to find how they can mutually enrich each other.

### The Renaissance of Making Things

What we're witnessing now, with the integration personal fabrication through Digital Fabrication in makerspaces and fablabs around the world, is nothing less than a "renaissance" of making, a reintegration of thinking and doing that the Renaissance itself separated. This reconnection is just correncting in Gershenfeld's words, a "historical error". Personal Fabrication represents a reclamation of physical literacy that complements rather than opposes digital literacy.

### Neo-Craftsmanship (The Future)

Looking towards the future, Gershenfeld envisions a convergence of digital design, personal expression, and industrial production that he describes as "a revolution that contains, rather than replaces, all of the prior revolutions." This neo-craftsmanship represents neither a rejection of technology, as with the Arts and Crafts movement did, nor an uncritical embrace of industrialization, but rather a synthesis that creates new paths and possibilities for crafts explorations without loosing what caracterizes the crfats.

If, what caracterices crafts as Richard Sennett argues, are the obstacles and resistances encountered that develop artisanal practice and understanding, Gershenfeld's work might suggest this is precisely what personal fabrication enables. not the elimination of challenges, but their democratization, allowing individuals to encounter and overcome them directly rather than having them mediated through industrial processes. Esta democratización de desafíos refleja una evolución natural del pensamiento de Morris, quien buscaba preservar la dignidad del trabajo manual y la conexión directa entre el artesano y su creación, aunque ahora a través de medios tecnológicos que Morris no podría haber imaginado.

This future raises questions about preservation. ***If, thanks to the "democratization" of personal fabrication, objects can be "perfectly" reproduced from digital files, what constitutes the "original"?*** ***Is it the physical artifact, the digital design, or the creative process itself?*** 
***"How can we faithfully preserve something whose essence lies precisely in its unrepeatability?"***

Perhaps, the answer lies in recognizing that preservation itself must evolve. Rather than focusing exclusively on protecting physical artifacts from the past, we might instead need to preserve the conditions that enable ongoing creation and reinvention. I personally find this related to the "Fab movement", Fablabs have helped establish around the world represent not just access to digital fabrication tools but the preservation of creative agency itself.








As we move toward the neo-craftsmanship, the historical division between art and craft that began in the Renaissance might be starting to heal. FabAcademy 
The "iliberal arts" will reclaim their place alongside the "liberal arts" not as separate domains but as integrated aspects of human creative expression. The question will no longer be whether something is art or craft, digital or physical, designed or made, but rather how effectively it embodies human creativity and meets human needs.






The liberal arts were originally meant to liberate, empowering through mastery of the means of expression. The new means of expression for personal fabrication offer technological empowerment, providing economic, intellectual, and even a kind of spiritual liberation.
I believe that the best place to read about the future of personal fabrication is in the faces of a new generation getting access to prototype versions of these capabilities in fab labs. Coming from many different parts of the planet, they end up in the same place: joy.


Gershenfeld ends his book with an observation about the universal human response to personal fabrication: "joy." This emotion—witnessed in contexts from MIT classrooms to Indian villages to Norwegian fishing communities—perhaps best captures what was lost in the artificial division of art from craft, and what stands to be regained in their reunion. In that joy, we may find the most compelling argument for why neo-craftsmanship matters, and why its preservation represents not just cultural conservation but a reclamation of our fullest human capabilities.
