# Technical mentality: Primciples for HCI Research and Practice


technical mentality, an onto-epistemology based on direct knowledge of technical objects and systems.

## Introduction

Technical objects and systems are all around us, yet their mechanisms and inner workings are mostly hidden or unknown. How much should people engage with and understand the mechanisms and inner workings of the technology they interact with?

to know how technical systems work is the condition to developing more sustainable relationships with technology. He wrote: "The most powerful cause of alienation in the contemporary world resides in this misunderstanding of the machine, which is not an alienation caused by the machine, but by the non-knowledge of its nature and its essence"

develop more horizontal and companionable relationships with technical objects and systems.

***Technical Mentality***

this paper as an initial step to formalize this demanding and exciting vision and its possible applications for HCI research.

Simondon's philosophical project has been described as a technological humanism


Simondon's concern with the non-human was less a move to decenter humans in ontological narratives

but to account for the processes that co-constitute humans and their tools. In this sense, Simondon's humanism was a rehabilitation of the 'non-human' dimension of technology into humanist accounts. He spoke of a "complete hu-manism" that could make space for technicity within its conception of humanity instead of seeing technology as alien to human reality.
Simondon was fond of the famous line by 2nd century BC Roman playwright Terence, humani nihil a me alienum puto: "nothing human is alien to me."

Simondon's philosophy is directly relevant to the field of HCI, which seeks to understand relationships between humans and computer systems and foster beneficial ones [26]. Since its inception, HCI has shifted from a dominant concern in building efficient machinery to designing meaningful interactions


Beyond its social and cultural implica-tions, the lack of knowledge of technical systems is a philosophical problem. It concerns our ability to think of "technology in the reality of its inventive becoming" [59, p. 109] rather than as purely a set of means, and therefore as static and already-determined re-alities.

We show that while Simondon's ideas have been influential in design theory, they have not yet been formalized into principles or guidelines for design practice.

emphasized the relevance of Simondon's philosophy to understand the role of technology in shaping processes of individuation in Western culture

shows how Simondon's theory of concretization extends constructivist perspectives in technology studies, not only by including non-human actors (as Actor-Network Theory did) but by attending to the role of "technical rationality"


Instead of describing technical objects through their social history or usage practices, Simondon is interested in their mechanisms, their design, their mode of operation, and the process of progressive innovations that develops parts and adapts tools and systems to a variety of functions.

Feenberg argues that Simondon's notion of concretization provides a way out from the false dilemma of "rationality versus ideology," where rationality is identified with technological understanding, efficiency and control, and ideology with the social agendas in systems design


Poulsgaard argues that computational design objects (designs, artifacts) emerge from the situated, material, informational and energetic operations enacted by various bodies.

While scholars have commented on the political and cultural implications of technical mentality [1, 21, 40, 91], the design orientation of Simondon's work has thus far remained implicit.

there are no longer
"knowers" on one side and "things known" on the other (Descartes' res cogitans and res extensa 23]) but individuals caught in an ongoing process of individuation that involves negotiations with the material, informational, and energetic potential of a given milieu.


Simondon's notion of operation, however, has particular relevance for HCI in that it provides the basis for a way of thinking technology from the inside. Simdonon defines an operation as the
"conversion of a structure into another structure" [96, p. 664]. Operations are also reified in machines and systems, which makes technology the potential ground for "a general science of opera-tions,"


Simondon's insistence on developing deeper relations with machines is expressed through his idea of the open machine.

 systems that are repairable, reconfigurable, and extendable; they are designed and built to allow the easy replacement of "weak parts,"

The notion of the open machine is an important tenet of technical mentality and has many parallels with seamful design. Seamful design refers to the strategic revelation of seams to better support technical integration and appropriation

invisibility is a property of human cognition, not design.

But troubleshooting, maintenance, extension, and reconfigurabil-ity often require a deeper understanding of the technology at hand than the user might have. Simondon is aware that this openness in technical systems requires "a certain level of technical competency" [94, p. 28] and therefore a certain conflation between the machine builder and its user. This is a recurring theme in Simondon's work, and he addresses this issue by emphasizing the need for technical knowledge to be distributed via infrastructure.

He writes:
" The openness of technical object ... supposes a second type of relation between builder and user: the builder must be represented on the entire territory of use by a network possessing the necessary parts [for repair and extension]. In other words, in addition to technical information, a material communication must connect the user to the builder. There can be no ... genuine openness of technical objects without the creation of a network of technicity. This condition is fundamental." [94, p. 28]

## Technical mentality in practice

CNC machines are controlled via code but the code (g-code, a series of coordinates that tell the machine where to move) is difficult to read and does not have great programmatic capabilities. Machine code specifies all the operations of the machine and is therefore an important design dimension of digital fabrication and yet, it tends to remain hidden behind software abstractions.

Technical mentality reveals and supports engagement with the operations of technical systems. As described in Section 5.1, machine control in fabrication is usually mediated by a toolpath-generating program, or CAM software. CAM software gives the ability to create complex toolpaths and does so partially by handling many manufacturing decisions to optimize other aspects of the milling process, such as as travel movements. This tends to relegate much of the domain expertise to the software rather than the user-which according to Noble, was an intentional design choice to seize production control from machinists [74]. From a design perspective, this prevents users from engaging with low-level machine control and therefore develop their own understanding of machine oper-ations.

Technical mentality supports extensibility and shareability. By virtue of making visible the underlying code that is usually hidden in traditional CAM software, Imprimer invites not only direct control of machines, but also the ability to keep the notebooks actual

Si-mondon writes that one of the key aspects of technical objects and systems is that, unlike living beings, there are not "metaphysically one and indissoluble" [1, p. 3]. They can be taken apart; they are reparable; they can be completed; they are (or can be) designed to be maintained, modified, and extended.
This principle of modularity, repairability, and extension also provides the model for a certain ethical orientation beyond systems building: "To accept or reject a being wholesale, because it is a whole, is perhaps to avoid adopting towards it the more generous attitude: namely, that of careful examination" [1, p. 4]. Technical objects that are built as closed and complete 'packages' hide the mechanisms of the system and therefore allow little opportunity to access their parts and components, making it difficult for users to maintain interpretative engagement [27] with the technical reality of the object. End-to-end fabrication systems tend to black box their operations, but Imprimer makes them visible and accessible by using computational notebooks that reveal the programs used to control the machine.

Technical mentality is an expression of technical openness. To-gether, these commitments form what Simondon perceives as the chief principle of technical mentality, that of openness. He writes:
"Technical reality lends itself remarkably well to being continued, completed, perfected, extended" [1, p. 13]. Openness is understood here as the conception and fabrication of artifacts that are flexi-ble, open to modification, repair and extension, and allow access to their 'technical' layer.

For Simondon, the "non-dissimulation of means" that characterizes the design of the building is an expression of technical mentality:

This fundamental conception of technicity as open, extensible and interoperable is strong and alive in open-source communities.

## TECHNICAL MENTALITY AS A DESIGN PROGRAM

### Extension
Extension refers to the design strategies that make systems able to be modified, extended, repaired, and maintained.
The first tenet of technical mentality is that "the subsets are relatively detachable from the whole of which they are a part" [1,
p. 3]. Technical objects and systems achieve their highest degree of technicity not when they are automated, which requires to sacrifice a number of possibilities of operations (which is useful for specific applications) but when they are open, that is able to be understood, reconfigured, extended, and maintained in a perpetual state of actuality.


Currently, the option to engage with the technicity of objects and systems-to open them up to understand their operations, or to repair or extend them—is difficult, resource-intensive and sometimes inaccessible

Technical mentality envisions a culture in which technical systems are not black boxed or simply consumed but constantly reactualized through practices of repair, care, extension, and invention.

Because machine toolpaths are usually hidden under layers of abstraction in CAD-CAM software such as Fusion360 [4], or expressed through G-code and therefore hard to read, the opportunities to build on, extend, modify, and share machine operations for CNC milling are rare and often limited to one user or one context.

### Integration

Integration refers to the design strategies that take into account the existing natural and artificial ecosystem in which a particular technology exists and will exist.

"if one wants to understand a being completely, one must study it by considering it in its entelechy, and not in its inactivity or its static state" [1, p. 4]. Simondon argues that technical objects are better understood 'in action, in the process of completing or realizing their function.


For instance, Internet of Things (loT) devices are smart objects only insofar as they are connected to a network-their entelechy, the realization of their potential, the dispensation of the services they are designed to offer, is achieved through their integration to an existing infras-tructure. Simondon warns against the technocratic attitude that consists in "reinventing the world like a neutral field for the penetration of machines"

Integration is part of understanding the object as part of a "global technicity"

"The tractor in a garage is merely a technical object; however, when it is at work plowing, leaning into the furrow while the soil is turned over, it can be perceived as beautiful. Any technical object, mobile or fixed, can have its aesthetic epiphany, insofar as it extends the world and becomes integrated into it."
[95, p. 197)
The beauty of the tractor is best grasped when it is at work, in the action that let it extends the world and become integrated into it.

### Legibility

Legibility refers to the design strategies that make the mechanisms or technical operations of systems visible and intelligible.

 In order to extend, modify, or care for a machine or sys-tem, one first needs to understand it.

systems can also be designed to support understanding of their mechanisms and operations, something we refer to as legibility.
Rather than focusing on the interface as the only humanly legible part of the system, this design principle states that the mechanisms of technical objects and systems should also be identified and arranged in ways that support their understanding.

Documentation is not extraneous to the system but part of it-it makes the tool more legible and therefore more likely to be understood, used, modified, and shared.


While literacy refers to the ability of the user or reader to decipher a text or system, we use the term legibility to emphasize the responsibility of designers, researchers, and technologists to make systems and their inner workings legible.


His suggestion is not so much to turn everyone into a maker but to cultivate an inventor and maker-like sensibility-to

Simondon notices that industrial production has warped the relationship with technical objects, as mass manufactured goods are conceived as things to own rather than things to engage with and care for. The object of industrial production allows for neither the exercise nor the development of the technical mentality because it is designed to be used and consumed as one entity, not as a
system that can be opened, repurposed, extended, and maintained in
actuality. By contrast, the amateur refers to the individual who seeks to understand because they like or love something and therefore invests not just money but also time, attention, care, and effort.

### Expression

Expression refers to the design strategies that encourage exploration, and experimentation with the operations and mechanisms of systems.

We argue that an inquisitive and exploratory attitude towards technical objects and systems is necessary to the development of technical mentality,

different from legibility in that it focuses not so much on the visibility of mechanisms and operations but on the perceptive, sensory and aesthetics transformations that occur in people and systems when visibility and access are enabled.
