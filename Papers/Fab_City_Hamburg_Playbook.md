The goal is to make cities "glocal", that is globally connected but locally productive - disrupting long and centralized supply chains, bringing manufacturing back into local communities, innovating within an open-source, circular-regenerative economic approach to design and production.

Together, we are creating a foundation for a resilient future — anchored locally, connected globally.

In the Fab City, the responsibility for the overdue socio-ecological transformation does not lie solely with business or politics, but rather becomes a shared generational project of urban society.

A comprehensive socio-ecological transformation is said to be necessary - but exactly what this should look like remains the subject of fierce debate.

## Cities as drivers of change?!
Cities may be the relevant target group. Although they operate within national legal frameworks, they have considerable room to initiate and implement the necessary changes.

Around half of the world's population now lives in cities and urban areas; in the EU it is as much as three-quarters,

Industrialization began in cities in the early 19th century, and ultimately, they are also the places where its negative consequences must be tackled. In other words: as fascinating as ecological rural communities may be in individual cases, they do not scale.


Production was first automated, then increasingly outsourced — primarily to Asia. At the same time, the division of labor was globalized: the postindustrial metropolises became centers of the tertiary sector, focused on services and the knowledge economy.

At first, this seemed like a new stage in a linear vision of progress — wasn't the sky blue again over the Ruhr region? Couldn't people once again swim in rivers that had previously been polluted?

it has become clear that post-industrial cities are not resilient.
This, in turn, often has a greater impact on socially disadvantaged sections of urban societies.


to strengthen local production again, or even rebuild it in some cases,

to hold them accountable for managing the waste and emissions they generate locally.

## THE VISION

Until cities produce (almost) everything they consume

The Fab City approach aims to radically transform the way cities meet their needs and produce for themselves. At its core is

the development of a local, circular-based production system. The Fab City approach combines insights and concepts from the three currently dominant strategies for urban transformation: circularity (reorganization of material flows in productive systems), smartness (use of digital technologies), and resilience (local, decentralized production).

The envisioned production model of a Fab City is essentially based on the premise that design and process knowledge circulate freely in digital form, while materials and material flows remain within local or regional cycles.

The goal of local interventions is primarily to provide interested individuals, start-ups, and companies with the opportunity to develop and manufacture new product ideas and prototypes. These should respond to local needs and challenges while (re)utilizing local resources. To achieve this goal, local manufacturing capacities and capabilities must be established and expanded. This involves not only setting up and providing production spaces, digital fabrication machines and platforms but also offering accessible workshops for various target groups and sectors. Additionally, it includes developing educational formats that teach

enabling individuals to independently create and manufacture circular, technical solutions.

strengthening knowledge and awareness of production and consumption processes

However, such an open-source-based circular economy requires a fundamentally new approach to the creation and use of goods and services of all kinds.

Only through the consistent development and application of open standards - such as design standards, material standards, manufacturing processes, open databases on waste, open educational resources- and their interaction at various levels can new patterns of use and business models emerge in the long term.

The project is driven by local communities in participating cities, which are networked worldwide and meet annually at a week-long global summit.

As a counter-narrative to the top-down approaches of technology-centric smart city concepts, Fab City favors open and loosely coupled coordination systems that empower people to "democratize" production and reclaim control over local production and consumption practices.

## FAB CITY MANIFESTO

01

ECOLOGICAL

We take an integrated approach to environmental stewardship, working towards a zero-emission future while also preserving biodiversity, rebalancing the nutrient cycle and sustaining natural resources.

02

INCLUSIVE

We promote equitable and inclusive policy co-design, through the development of a Commons Approach, regardless of age, gender, income-levels and capabilities.

03

GLOCALISM

We encourage global knowledge sharing between cities and territories in order to provide access to tools and solutions that could be adapted to local cultures and needs.

LOCA PROT

We suppo of all loca economy and vibra

04

PARTICIPATORY

We engage with all stakeholders in decision-making processes and empower citizens to take ownership of innovation and change-making.

05

ECONOMIC GROWTH

& EMPLOYMENT

We support sustainable urban economic growth by investing in building the skills, infrastructure and policy frameworks needed for the 21st century, thanks to a thorough consideration of social and environmental externalities and the implementation of the polluter pays principle.

06

LOCALLY

PRODUCTIVE

We support the efficient and shared use of all local available resources in a circular economy approach to build a productive and vibrant city.

07

PEOPLE-CENTERED

We give priority to people and culture over technology, so that the city can become a living and resilient ecosystem. Autonomous vehicles, digital tools, artificial intelligence and robotic machines must be placed at the service of the people's well-being and expectations.

08

HOLISTIC

We address urban issues in all their dimension and interdependencies to build sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities for everyone.

09

OPEN SOURCE PHILOSOPHY

We foster a Digital Commons Approach that adheres to open source principles and values open data, in order to stimulate innovation and develop shared solutions between cities and territories.

10

EXPERIMENTAL

In order to meet the principles just outlined, we actively support the research, experimentation and deployment of innovation which includes but is not limited to: low impact supply chains; distributed production; renewable energy and smart grids; sustainable food and urban agriculture; recycling and reuse of materials, sustainable resource management for energy, food and materials.

## THE EXPERIMENT

Against the backdrop of the reality in many cities, the Fab City vision may seem like a distant utopia - a Shangri-La for dreamers and advocates of the socio-ecological transformation.

The question arises: under what conditions can such an urban production model emerge and function?

But what happens when there is insufficient empirical data to apply conventional scientific methods? When the questions we ask are future-oriented and so complex that no single field of study can provide a complete answer? What if the outcome is open and the solutions to be developed can only be promising if they are designed and implemented with the involvement of those who stand to benefit from them?

Due to the lack of empirical cases, broader data sets and suitable theoretical explanatory models, this only works within the framework of an explorative, experimental approach in a realistic environment.

explore, test, and validate lal concepts, technologies and processes of the open-source-based circular Fab City production model in different stakeholder constellations and industrial contexts

The use of open-source technologies (so-called open-source hardware) in production and manufacturing offers a major advantage: Users have the ability and the right to modify, replicate and sell designs as they see fit. This enables participation in global communities for further development and innovation. Design and manufacturing knowledge can circulate freely, while production takes place locally in a decentralized network.

The COVID-19 crisis has shown us how important it is to understand products, production processes and value chains, and to make them more robust.

"Craftsmanship is the natural partner for the circular economy. By tradition, artisans have always created repairable products.

Andreas Rönnau, Hamburg Chamber of Crafts

However, those who only think about waste disposal fail to recognize the diversity of circular economy. This encompasses production, consumption, value retention, and new business models.

From an urban planning perspective, the types of products that can be manufactured in cities include, among others, semi-finished products, prototypes, packaging, enclosures, spare parts, medical technology, as well as personalized or specialized niche products and custom-made items.

The first step is to strengthen local (circular) production capacities by directly supplying as many everyday goods as possible. At the same time, a global digital infrastructure must be developed to facilitate the free circulation of customizable designs and manufacturing instructions.
