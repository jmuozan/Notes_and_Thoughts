At the intersection of tradition and technology, AI.RTISANSHIP attempts to analyze what characterizes artisanal work, if there is an essence to it, and if this essence can be transmitted. Using computer vision detection systems, different artisans were recorded using their craft technique on the pottery wheel, and then this data was used in a machine learning process with the aim of digitizing, preserving, and "teaching" this valuable cultural heritage.

As a result of the experiment, it was possible to conclude that craftsmanship and its expression go beyond technique. For good practice, a connection between hand and head is required. According to sociologist Richard Sennett, the good artisan integrates thought and action in a constant dialogue between concrete practices and thinking, which is based on direct experience, practice, and the obstacles and resistances that the artisan encounters, which foster the development of skill and understanding. All previous experiences shape practice and vice versa. For this reason, artisanal knowledge becomes personal and unique. Just as we cannot find two identical leaves on a tree, we will never find two identical vessels, even when they are created using the same technique. This uniqueness is not accidental but essential to the nature of the artisanal object, as each piece materializes an unrepeatable moment of interaction between the artisan, the material, and the specific circumstances. When attempting to capture this process through computer vision, a paradox is created: digitization records movements but cannot capture the decision taking process, the tactile responses to the behavior of the clay, or the mental state of the artisan. This unique decision making methods not only justify the importance of preserving the artisanal process but also raises the following question: ***how can we faithfully preserve something whose essence lies precisely in its unrepeatability?***

***If, as Sennett argues, it is the obstacles and resistances encountered that develop artisanal practice and understanding, shouldn't we focus our efforts on preserving this process of obstacles and resistance rather than the technique itself?***
