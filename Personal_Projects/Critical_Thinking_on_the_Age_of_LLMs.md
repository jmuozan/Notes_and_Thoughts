# AI Usage and Critical Thinking development in schools: Learning from the classroom

## Overview

The integration of artificial intelligence, specifically large language models (LLMs), into educational contexts cr4eates a new set of challenges for educators. 

Has AI usage in schools inevitable? if so, how can educators guide students to develop the critical faculties necessary to navigate in this new landscape without becoming overly dependent on AI tools. The challenge lies not just in teaching students to use AI effectively, but in helping them understand the limitations, biases, and appropriate applications of these technologies while maintaining their capacity for independent, critical thought.

## TPACK 

The established TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) framework, which is develop to help educators integrate technology meaningfully into their practice, might require a significant expansion with the emergence of AI technologies.

This framework encompasses three core knowledge domains. Content Knowledge representing the educator's deep understanding of their subject matter. Pedagogical Knowledge encompasses the "art and science" of teaching, including understanding of learning theories, instructional design principles, classroom management strategies, and assessment methodologies. Lastly, Technological Knowledge represents the understanding of how to select, use, and integrate the technologies into curriculum and instruction.




Educators cannot effectively teach what they do not deeply understand, specially when dealing with AI technologies. Teachers who lack a fundamental understanding of how AI systems work, their limitations, and their potential for bias or error, cannot guide students in developing appropriate critical thinking skills around these technologies.

Educators may feel overwhelmed by the rapid pace of AI development and uncertain about how to incorporate these tools meaningfully into their practice. The development must address not only the technical aspects of AI tools but also the pedagogical strategies needed to foster (no se si lo estoy usando bien aqu√≠ este verbo) critical thinking.



Students today are growing up in an environment where AI generated content is increasingly prevalent, yet many lack the skills to evaluate the reliability and appropriateness of AI outputs.

Source evaluation might be one of the biggest issues students must learn to distinguish not only between reliable and unreliable human sources but also between AI-generated and human generated content, 

developing strategies for source verification can be interesting.

Most importantly, students need to develop skills in synthesis that allow them to combine AI assistance with their own critical thinking rather than simply accepting AI outputs uncritically. copying and vomiting outputs, similar to "traditional ways of learning" before AI just this time without even learning it.







A modular design of the framework can allow for adaptation to different classroom contexts while maintaining consistency in core learning objectives.

However, the framework must also extend beyond traditional classroom boundaries to address how students use AI in their personal lives, at home, and eventually in their professional contexts. This requires developing self-assessment tools that help students monitor their own AI usage patterns and dependency levels, creating resources for families to understand and support AI literacy development, and establishing guidelines for appropriate AI use in different contexts.

The scalability challenge involves ensuring that the critical thinking skills developed in educational settings transfer to other areas of students' lives, including their future professional contexts, personal decision-making, and civic engagement. This requires thinking beyond immediate classroom applications to consider how these skills will serve students throughout their lives as AI becomes increasingly prevalent in society.

## Moving Beyond Traditional Assessment Approaches

One of the most significant challenges identified in this research involves rethinking assessment strategies in an age where students have access to sophisticated AI tools. The traditional approach of creating "safe" questions that can be easily answered by AI systems is no longer sustainable, as it fails to develop the critical thinking skills students need and may actually encourage over-reliance on AI assistance.

Instead, the research explores assessment approaches that focus on evaluating thinking processes rather than just final answers. This involves developing methods to assess how students approach problems, how they evaluate and synthesize information from multiple sources including AI, and how they demonstrate understanding of underlying concepts rather than just their ability to produce correct responses.

Process-focused assessment requires students to document and explain their reasoning, including how they used AI tools, what steps they took to verify information, and how they synthesized AI assistance with their own thinking. This approach makes the thinking process visible and allows educators to identify areas where students may be struggling with critical evaluation or becoming overly dependent on AI assistance.

The research also explores the use of metacognitive reflection as an assessment strategy, requiring students to explicitly consider and articulate their own thinking processes, their use of AI tools, and their confidence in different aspects of their responses. This helps students develop self-awareness about their AI usage patterns while providing educators with insights into student learning processes.

Real-world application assessments focus on problems that require local knowledge, current events awareness, or synthesis of information from multiple sources in ways that cannot be easily replicated by AI systems alone. Creative synthesis tasks require students to combine information from various sources in original ways, demonstrating their ability to think creatively and critically rather than simply reproducing AI-generated content.

## Research questions

- How does explicit AI literacy instruction affect students' critical thinking about information?
- How can we measure improvement in students' ability to think critically about AI-generated content?
- Do vocational and academic track students require different approaches?
