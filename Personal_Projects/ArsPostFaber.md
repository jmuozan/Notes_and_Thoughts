**Abstract**

Digital fabrication technologies have democratized access to production tools while perpetuating the industrial-era separation between design conception and material execution. This division, which historically diminished artisanship by fragmenting holistic creative processes, continues to manifest in contemporary CAD/CAM workflows that privilege computational precision over the embodied knowledge and tacit decision-making central to craft traditions. Current digital representation formats often reduce creation to pure geometry, failing to preserve the intimate material relationships and adaptive responses that characterize traditional making practices.

This research challenges the assumption that fabrication democratization is achieved solely through access to scaled-down industrial tools. Instead, it argues for a reimagination of the relationship between maker, material, and technology, seeking to restore the holistic nature of creative practice within digital contexts. The following study addresses how to preserve creative agency, embodied knowledge, and capacity for personal expression in digital fabrication contexts.

Through experimental tool testing and digital fabrication workshops with artisans and makers, this research develops **_Ars Post Faber_**, an open-source Grasshopper plug-in within the Rhinoceros CAD environment that approaches making as an integrated practice. The plug-in implements utilities designed to facilitate fluid Human-Software-Machine interactions, enabling embodied expression, contextual adaptation, and tacit knowledge to flow throughout the making process. Rather than abstracting away the creative journey, this approach looks to preserve the complete narrative of creation, including modifications, errors, and decision points, as integral components of the final work.

By attempting to bridge the gap between digital design and material execution, this research looks to contribute to evolving discussions around craft, technology, and creative agency in the digital age, suggesting that true democratization requires representational frameworks that honor the complexity and continuity of human creative processes.

**Chapter 1: The Architecture of Making: Tracing Agency Through Historical and Digital Workflows**

The transformation of making practices from medieval workshops to contemporary fabrication methods represents a reconfiguration of how creative decisions flow through productive and creative processes. A pathway to understand the current challenges of creativeness in current productive processes would be to trace how creative agency, defined as "meaningful intentional action" (Niedderer & Townsend, 2024) that enables makers to exercise their decision-making authority throughout the making process, has been systematically redistributed across different historical moments and technological contexts.

Medieval artisan guilds[[1]](#_ftn1), operated through integrated knowledge systems where individual craftspeople maintained comprehensive understanding of their entire productive domain. As Richardson (2008) notes, these guilds were "organized along trade lines" with members who "shared religious observances and fraternal dinners," creating communities where the guilds ensured production standards were maintained through collective oversight of the complete production process. In that way, the master carpenter knew not only how to shape wood but why specific joints were chosen, when to adapt techniques for different grain patterns, and how environmental conditions would affect long-term structural integrity. This integration of conceptual understanding with material execution created what might be recognized as complete creative agency, decision-making authority distributed throughout the entire making process rather than concentrated in separate planning phases.

The appearance of industrial production following the industrial revolution[[2]](#_ftn2) altered the foundations of these relationships of agency by introducing systematic specialization. Frederick Winslow Taylor's principles of scientific management exemplified this transformation, advocating for the concentration of knowledge in management roles while reducing workers to executors of predetermined actions. As Taylor argued, "the managers assume, for instance, the burden of gathering together all of the traditional knowledge which in the past has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying, tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, and formulae which are immensely helpful to the workmen in doing their daily work." (Taylor, 1919). This extraction and centralization of craft knowledge created the foundation for what Harry Braverman[[3]](#_ftn3) later identified in _Labor and Monopoly Capital_ (1974) as the systematic separation of conception from execution, a division that altered to the core the relationship between thinking and making that had characterized traditional craft practice until then.

However, this transformation did not proceed unopposed. From the direct resistance of Luddism against mechanization to the reformist proposals of the _Arts & Crafts_ movement, various social movements emerged to challenge the dehumanization of productive work. The Luddites, British textile workers active between 1811-1816, responded to the industrial mechanization not through a bland opposition to technology, but as historian Malcolm I. Thomis observed, because machine-breaking represented a strategic form of "collective bargaining by riot" (Thomis, 1993) when "orthodox" negotiation was impossible due to restrictive anti-union legislation and the scattered nature of industrial work. As Thomis documented, "machine-breaking was, of course, by no means a new phenomenon when it appeared in Nottinghamshire in March 1811, being almost a time-honoured tradition among certain occupational groups," (Thomis 1993) used to "effectively and quickly strike at an offensive local employer." (Thomis 1993) Interestingly, the author noted that "these attacks on machines did not imply any necessary hostility to machinery as such; machinery was just a conveniently exposed target against which an attack could be made" (Thomis 1993). Even contemporary observers like Lord Byron[[4]](#_ftn4) recognized that these actions originated from "circumstances of the most unparalleled distress" when skilled craftsmen found "their own means of subsistence were cut off" by mechanization (Byron 1812). The Luddite resistance thus represented not technophobic reaction but a defense of workers' economic position and creative autonomy within production processes that industrialization threatened to eliminate.

On the other hand, the Arts & Crafts movement, emerging later in the century, offered a more intellectual critique of industrial production's effects on the creative agency of the craftspeople. John Ruskin[[5]](#_ftn5), one of the setters of the movement's "intellectual" foundation, argued in _The Stones of Venice_ that industrial mechanization represented a fundamental assault on human dignity, writing that "we have much studied and much perfected, of late, the great civilized invention of the division of labour; only we give it a false name. It is not, truly speaking, the labour that is divided; but the men: Divided into mere segments of men, broken into small fragments and crumbs of life" (Ruskin, 1892). William Morris[[6]](#_ftn6), inspired by Ruskin's critique, looked to restore what he called "art which is made by the people and for the people, as a happiness to the maker and the user" (The Free Library 2014), advocating for production methods that would reunite intellectual conception with manual execution. Morris believed that creative work should demonstrate "obvious traces of the hand of man guided directly by his brain, without more interposition of machines than is absolutely necessary to the nature of the work done" (Morris, 1882).

These movements shared a fundamental concern: the industrial division of labor threatened not merely economic arrangements but the essential human capacity for creative agency. Walter Crane[[7]](#_ftn7), leader of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, articulated this critique in _The Claims of Decorative Art_ arguing that "the apotheosis of commercialism meant the degradation of art" (Crane 1892) and lamenting that under industrial conditions there can be no possibility "of the pleasure of the craftsman in fashioning his work, to give it the individual twist and play of fancy, the little touch of grace and ornamental feeling springing from the organic necessities of the work which is characteristic of the times when art and handicraft were united and living" (Crane 1892). Crane specifically attacked how industrialization had created a world where "all the useful labours are made either terrible by long hours, or emptied of all joy and interest by being reduced to mechanism" (Crane 1892). His vision opposed the industrial reduction of workers to mere components, advocating instead for the reunification of art and handicraft that had been systematically divided by mechanization, essentially calling for a return to the integrated knowledge systems that guilds had once provided. Yet despite their moral urgency, none of these resistance movements could halt the broader trajectory towards a systematic separation of conception from execution that would later go on to characterize fabrication workflows.

**Contemporary Digital Workflows**

Contemporary digital design workflows extend this historical fragmentation into new technological domains, perpetuating the separation Harry Braverman observed through software architectures and computational processes. The traditional craftsperson's embodied knowledge, held in hands, eyes, and intuitive understanding of materials, becomes progressively abstracted through layers of digital mediation[[8]](#_ftn8). Modern Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD/CAM)[[9]](#_ftn9) systems create distinct operational phases: human conceptualization, software translation, machine execution, and material output. Each transition representing a potential loss of agency, as the maker's intentionality becomes increasingly distant from the final artifact.

This technological mediation alters the temporal and spatial relationship between maker and making. Unlike the tradictional craftsperson who could adjust techniques in real-time based on material feedback, adapting to wood grain variations or clay consistency, digital workflows require predetermined specifications that resist improvisation once manufacturing begins. The maker's presence becomes temporally displaced: design decisions occur in abstract digital space often days or weeks before physical production, while the actual fabrication happens in the maker's absence through automated processes. This separation not only removes opportunities for responsive adjustment but also eliminates the iterative dialogue between intention, material resistance, and emergent discovery that characterized traditional craft practice.

The research _Embodied Knowledge in Digital Spaces: Towards Human-Centered Fabrication Formats_ suggests that current representation formats used by digital fabrication machines "prioritize geometric precision over embodied knowledge, reducing complex creative processes to coordinates and mechanical instructions" (Muñoz, 2025). The dominance of formats like G-code, which controls CNC machines and 3D printers through standardized commands, exemplifies how digital workflows eliminate the experiential knowledge that craftspeople traditionally embedded within their making processes. These technical standards capture precise geometric specifications but cannot encode the tacit understanding, material sensitivity, or adaptive decision-making from the craft practice.

This fragmentation can be seen at multiple levels simultaneously. Beyond the limitations of individual file formats, entire workflow architectures perpetuate the conception-execution divide through their structure. Digital fabrication requires users to navigate between specialized software environments: Computer Aided Design applications for conceptufalization, Computer Aided Manufacturing programs for toolpath generation, and machine-specific control interfaces for execution. Each software transition introduces potential "breakdown points", moments where creative flow encounters resistance or translation errors. The cumulative effect transforms the continuous dialogue between maker and material into a series of discrete, mediated steps where creative agency gets affected with each technological translation.

**Mapping Agency: From Unified to Fragmented Control**

These contemporary fragmentation patterns echo broader historical transformations in the organization of creative work. The historical trajectory that can be traced from medieval guilds through industrial mechanization to contemporary digital workflows reveals a systematic redistribution of creative control that demands more precise examination. This transformation represents not merely technological evolution, but a restructuring of how decision-making authority flows through productive processes. To understand the implications for contemporary digital fabrication, it becomes necessary to map these different configurations of agency as distinct organizational forms, each embodying particular relationships between human intention, technological mediation, and material execution.

_Unified Agency: The Craftsperson's Integrated Practice_

Traditional craft practice operated through what this research terms unified agency, a configuration where conceptual understanding, material manipulation, and adaptive decision-making remain within the craftsperson's direct control. This represents more than the romantic notion of "hands-on" making; it constitutes a particular organizational form where creative authority flows through continuous feedback loops between intention and execution.

David Pye's concept of the "workmanship of risk" captures precisely this configuration: "the quality of the result is not predetermined, but depends on the judgment, dexterity and care which the maker exercises as he works" (Pye, 1971, p. 20). In this unified system, the craftsperson's tools operate as extensions of the body capability rather than barriers to creative intention. The hammer becomes an extension of the arm, the chisel an extension of touch, creating what cognitive scientists term "coupled systems" where human and tool function as integrated cognitive units. This coupling enables the real-time responsiveness that defines craft practice: the ability to read material feedback, adjust technique mid-process, and allow discovery to emerge through the dialogue between maker and medium. The significance of this integrated system lies in how it enables _adaptive authority_, the capacity to modify design decisions based on material feedback, unexpected discoveries, or emergent possibilities that pop up during the making process, where creative control remains responsive to material conditions rather than predetermined by separate planning phases.

_Distributed Agency: Industrial and Digital Fragmentation_

The industrial transformation traced through Taylorism and later digital workflows created what this research identifies as distributed agency: a configuration where creative control becomes fragmented across separate operational domains, each governed by different systems and often different human operators. This represents a different organizational form from unified agency, not merely a technological updating of traditional craft practice.

Distributed agency operates through the "externalization of knowledge, expectation, understanding, and other elements of self" across spatial and technological domains (Enfield & Kockelman, 2017). In digital fabrication, this externalization becomes problematic fragmentation: the craftsperson's unified practice gets distributed across discrete technological phases, each operating according to its own technical logic. Unlike the concept of "emplaced action" mentioned by the authors, where place and action remain integrated, digital workflows create a "displaced action," where creative decisions become separated from their material consequences through layers of technological mediation.

Each stage of this distributed system operates as a different "place" with its own material and symbolic boundaries that shape what actions become possible. CAD environments privilege geometric precision and parametric relationships, effectively "placing" the designer within a mathematical abstraction that rewards certain types of thinking while constraining others. Toolpath generation software functions as an intermediary place governed by manufacturing efficiency and machine limitations, where the designer's intentions must conform to algorithmic optimization routines. Finally, the physical fabrication environment operates according to mechanical precision and material properties, but by this point the maker has been effectively displaced from direct engagement with these material realities. This sequential displacement across technological places creates a crisis of accountability: when creative decisions become distributed across multiple technological domains, the maker loses the direct responsiveness that is central to emplaced action.

_The Loss of Adaptive Authority_

The biggtest difference between unified and distributed agency lies not only in the number of technological intermediaries involved, but in the elimination of what this research identifies a s _adaptive authority_, being the capacity for real-time modification of creative decisions based on emergent conditions. Traditional craft practice embedded this adaptive capacity throughout the making process, enabling continuous negotiation between intention and material response.

Distributed agency, by contrast, concentrates adaptive authority within the initial design phase while rendering subsequent stages increasingly deterministic. Once geometric specifications are locked into CAD files and translated through manufacturing software, the system resists the kinds of responsive modifications that characterized traditional craft dialogue between maker and material.

The emergence of increasingly sophisticated computational processes, from parametric optimization to AI-generated design variations, intensifies this structural limitation. These developments may increase the sophistication of initial design exploration, but they operate within the same distributed architecture that concentrates creative authority in separate planning phases while rendering material execution increasingly automated and non-responsive.

_Towards Alternative Configurations_

Understanding agency as organizationally configured rather than technologically determined suggests possibilities for alternative approaches to digital fabrication. Rather than accepting the distributed model as inevitable, this research explores whether digital systems might be structured to preserve adaptive authority throughout the making process, enabling the continuous dialogue between intention and material while leveraging the capabilities of contemporary fabrication technologies.

**Reclaiming Agency Within Technological Constraints**

Out of this historical trajectory from unified craft practice through industrial fragmentation to contemporary digital workflows emerges a clear challenge: the problem facing makers today is not technological limitation but organizational structure. The tools themselves, CNC machines, 3D printers, and parametric design software, represent unprecedented capabilities for material manipulation and geometric exploration. Yet their integration within distributed agency frameworks eliminates the adaptive authority that enabled traditional craftspeople to maintain creative control throughout the making process.

Current approaches to fabrication "democratization" have focused primarily on access, making industrial machines smaller, cheaper, and more widely available, without addressing the key workflow architectures that perpetuate the separation of conception from execution. The path forward followed by this research will require a _tactical appropriation_: working within existing technological ecosystems while reorganizing their logic to restore the continuous dialogue between intention and material response.

Unlike the Luddites' strategic machine-breaking or the Arts & Crafts movement's wholesale rejection of industrial methods, this approach recognizes that contemporary technological capabilities need not inevitably fragment creative agency. The challenge lies not in the machines themselves but in reorganizing how they are deployed within making workflows. The following chapters will examine how such reorganization might operate in practice, exploring pathways toward post-industrial craft practices that combine computational precision with organizational structures preserving the maker's capacity for real-time adaptation, contextual response, and embodied decision-making.

**Chapter 2: Rethinking Democratization: Beyond Access to Preservation**

The historical trajectory examined in Chapter 1 has showed how creative agency has been systematically redistributed from unified practice to contemporary digital workflows. This analysis raises the question: if digital fabrication technologies possess unprecedented capabilities for material manipulation and geometric exploration, why do they continue to perpetuate the same distributed agency frameworks that eliminated adaptive authority? The answer lies in how the "democratization" itself has been conceptualized within digital fabrication discourse.

Rather than addressing the organizational structures that fragment creative agency, contemporary digital fabrication has pursued democratization primarily through expanded access to scaled-down industrial tools. This chapter will examine how this access-centered approach, while achieving remarkable quantitative success, fails to address the deeper structural issues identified in the historical analysis. By tracing the evolution from access-based democratization toward preservation-centered approaches, this chapter will try to pursue a reconceptualization of what democratic making might mean in digital contexts.

**The Access Paradigm and Its Achievements**

This access-centered understanding of democratization has become the dominant paradigm within contemporary digital fabrication discourse. Neil Gershenfeld's[[10]](#_ftn10) foundational vision for FabLabs[[11]](#_ftn11) promised "personal fabrication" enabling "almost anyone to make almost anything" \citep{gershenfeld2007}, positioning digital fabrication as the natural evolution of personal computing—bringing the same accessibility that desktop computers brought to information processing into the realm of physical manufacturing. This vision emphasized scaling down industrial production capabilities to individual users, making sophisticated fabrication tools available in community workshops and educational institutions.

Building on this foundation, the broader maker movement, as articulated by Mark Hatch, advocated for "radically democratizing access to the tools of innovation" \citep{hatch2013}, framing making as both a form of personal empowerment and economic opportunity. Hatch's manifesto positioned the maker movement as a response to mass production's alienation, promising that widespread access to fabrication tools would restore individual agency in production while fostering innovation and entrepreneurship at the grassroots level.

This approach has achieved remarkable quantitative success: from fewer than 50 FabLabs worldwide in 2009 to over 2,000 by 2023 (Fab Foundation, 2024), there's been an unprecedented expansion of access to sophisticated production capabilities.

This democratization of digital fabrication extends beyond physical tools to software infrastructures. Open-source and free CAD alternatives like FreeCAD, Blender or TinkerCAD combined with educational programs to know how to use the tools, have reduced barriers to digital design literacy. Contemporary maker spaces enable individual access to CNC machines, 3D printers, and laser cutters for modest fees (sometimes even for free), genuinely transforming the economic conditions of making.

Yet this access-focused paradigm highlights certain limitations when examined against historical precedents of successful democratization movements. The expansion of who can use fabrication tools does not address how those tools structure agency within making processes. As Tanenbaum et al. observe, maker practices still depend heavily on existing industrial infrastructure and face challenges "when it comes to scaling up production and distribution" (Tanenbaum et al., 2013).

**The Preservation Problem**

While the quantitative expansion of fabrication access represents genuine progress, it reveals limitations in how democratization has been conceptualized. What contemporary digital fabrication lacks is what this research identifies as a preservation problem: the loss of tacit knowledge and embodied practices that characterize skilled making. This goes beyond the historical fragmentation patterns analyzed in Chapter 1 to encompass how knowledge itself is transmitted, maintained, and evolved within making communities.

Richard Sennett's analysis of craftsmanship emphasizes that "the desire to do something well for its own sake" \citep{sennet2009} requires forms of embodied learning that resist systematic codification. Unlike explicit knowledge that can be documented in manuals or encoded in software, tacit knowledge emerges through sustained engagement with materials, tools, and techniques.

Contemporary digital fabrication workflows eliminate opportunities for this knowledge transmission. While FabLabs and maker spaces provide access to sophisticated tools, they typically operate through standardized tutorials and predetermined project sequences that prioritize rapid skill acquisition over deep material understanding. The emphasis on "democratizing" access often translates into simplifying workflows to reduce learning curves, eliminating the complex, time-intensive processes through which tacit knowledge traditionally develops.

This preservation problem manifests through persistent organizational structures that extend beyond individual tool use. Despite the collaborative and educational dimensions of maker spaces, the workflow architecture maintains the distributed agency pattern traced in Chapter 1. Creative decisions remain concentrated in separate design phases, while material execution follows predetermined procedures that eliminate opportunities for the responsive adaptation. The result is a democratization that provides access to tools without preserving the knowledge systems that enable those tools to support genuine creative agency.

The insight that emerges from this analysis is that democratization cannot be achieved through access alone, it requires organizational innovation that preserves the continuity of creative decision-making throughout the making process. This shifts focus from who can use fabrication tools to how those tools can be structured to maintain what was identified in Chapter 1 as unified agency.

**Redefining Democratization: Process Over Access**

Through the analysis of the preservation problem it's possible to raise the question about how "democratization" has been conceptualized within digital fabrication discourse. While the term implies expanding democratic participation, current approaches, as mentioned, focus primarily on access expansion rather than examining what democratic participation actually requires. Before proposing alternative models for fabrication democratization, it becomes necessary to question what "democracy" itself demands and how those requirements might apply to making contexts.

The analysis of different precedents and patterns suggest that democratization movements across multiple domains initially focus on access expansion before recognizing deeper structural challenges. Political democratization, educational reform, and cultural preservation movements all showcase patterns that would align with it: early phases emphasize expanding participation within existing systems, while later phases require fundamental transformation of the systems themselves. For instance, political democratization initially focused on expanding voting rights, but later required systematic changes like proportional representation systems such as the D'Hondt method\footnote{The D'Hondt method is a proportional representation electoral system that allocates seats based on vote share, developed to ensure more democratic representation beyond simple majority voting.} to ensure genuine democratic representation rather than mere voting access. Similarly, educational democratization moved beyond simply expanding school enrollment to developing pedagogical approaches that understand and accommodate diversity in the classroom, adapting curricula to different learning styles and cultural backgrounds rather than imposing standardized approaches. These precedents suggest that fabrication democratization may be encountering similar limitations inherent to access-based approaches.

Rather than assuming that broader tool access automatically produces democratic participation, the following analysis will examine what democracy actually requires and how those requirements might inform alternative approaches to fabrication democratization. By analyzing democratic theory alongside cross-cultural preservation practices, this chapter will attempt to develop frameworks for distinguishing between superficial access and substantive democratic participation in production processes.

**Deconstructing "Democratization": What Democracy Actually Requires**

The theoretical framework established requires a deeper examination of the term "democratization" itself and its specific application to fabrication contexts. While democratic theory provides extensive analysis of political participation, its principles have been applied to fabrication with insufficient critical examination of what democratic participation might actually require within making processes. The word "democracy" derives from the Greek {\greekfont δημοκρατία} (demokratia) demos (people) + kratos (power/rule), meaning rule by the people. This etymology suggests that democratization involves the distribution of ruling authority rather than expanded access to predetermined systems, a distinction with big implications for how fabrication democratization should be conceptualized.

Political democracy, at its core, requires the distribution of decision-making authority among participants rather than merely access to predetermined decision-making processes. As Robert Dahl's\footnote{Robert A. Dahl (1915--2014) was an American political theorist whose work on democratic theory, shaped contemporary understanding of democratic systems and citizen engagement.} foundational analysis demonstrates, democratic systems must provide "effective participation" \citep{coglianese1990} where citizens have "basic political rights and liberties, such as free expression, and allows persons to live under laws of their own choosing" \citep{coglianese1990}, and enlightened understanding enabling informed choice among alternatives. Crucially, democracy requires what Dahl terms "final control over the agenda" \citep{mayhew2017}, the authority to determine not just outcomes within predetermined options, but the capacity to define what questions get asked and how they are framed. Distinguishing genuine democratic participation from consultative processes that solicit input within predetermined parameters while concentrating agenda-setting authority elsewhere.

Applied to fabrication contexts, this analysis reveals that current maker spaces, despite their collaborative ethos, preserve a fabrication autocracy, a system that concentrates creative authority in separate design phases while relegating material execution to predetermined procedures that eliminate participant agency. Genuine fabrication democratization would require the distribution of creative decision-making authority throughout making processes, enabling makers to exercise "final control over the agenda" not just in initial design specification, but in determining how fabrication workflows themselves operate and evolve in response to material conditions and emergent discoveries.

**The Representation Problem in Fabrication Democracy**

Having established that genuine democratization requires the distribution of decision-making authority rather than mere access expansion, it becomes necessary to examine how such authority might be structured within fabrication contexts. Political democracy usually confronts the challenge of representation: how to enable large-scale collective decision-making while preserving individual agency? This requires sophisticated institutional frameworks, electoral systems, deliberative processes, and constitutional protections that mediate between individual preferences and collective outcomes without eliminating personal autonomy.

Fabrication democratization faces analogous representational challenges: how to enable collective access to sophisticated manufacturing capabilities while preserving individual makers' authority to determine their own creative processes? Yet current digital fabrication has developed no equivalent to democratic political institutions. Instead, it has adopted  a technocratic representation, expert-designed software interfaces and standardized file formats that mediate between human intention and material execution while eliminating opportunities for maker input beyond initial design specification.

This technocratic approach mirrors Joseph Schumpeter's\footnote{Joseph Schumpeter (1883-1950) was an Austrian economist and politic who developed influential theories about capitalism and democratic systems.} theory of democracy as "competitive leadership" \citep{schumpeter1950}, a system that preserves formal democratic procedures while concentrating substantive decision-making authority within expert institutions. Just as this limited democracy enables citizen participation within predetermined choices while eliminating popular control over the agenda setting, just as current fabrication democratization enables maker participation within predetermined expert designed workflow structures while eliminating authority over how those structures have to be operated.

**Participatory Democracy and Making**

The technocratic representation reflects what participatory democratic theorists have long criticized in conventional political systems. Rather than accepting the limited model of democracy as competitive leadership, theorists like Carole Pateman advocate for democracy as active participation across all spheres of social life, "a society where all political systems have been democratised and socialisation through participation can take place in all areas" \citep{pateman1976}. Pateman argues that democratic capacity cannot be developed through formal instruction alone but emerges through the practice of exercising democratic authority in concrete contexts.

For fabrication democratization, out of this participatory approach can be extracted that creative agency develops itself through sustained engagement with decision-making throughout the making process rather than through standardized training in predetermined procedures. This would challenge the separation between tool designers and tool users that characterizes current maker spaces, and processes, requiring structures that enable makers to collectively determine how fabrication workflows themselves operate and evolve. Instead of accepting expert-designed workflow structures as fixed constraints, participatory fabrication would enable makers to exercise that "final control over the agenda".

**Deconstructing "Preservation"**

Out of the democracy framework outlined in this research can be assumed that genuine fabrication democratization requires preserving makers' capacity for ongoing creative authority rather than simply expanding access to predetermined tools. This shifts the focus from "democratization" as access provision to "democratization" as preservation of agency. But what kind of preservation enables rather than constrains democratic participation? The concept of "preservation" itself requires an examination, as its application to craft knowledge has been heavily influenced by cultural heritage frameworks that reproduce the same static approaches that align with access-based democratization.

Understanding preservation through cross-cultural perspectives can reveal assumptions embedded within Western conservation models and might highlight alternative approaches more suitable for maintaining the creative agency that democratic fabrication requires.

**Preservation as Dynamic Process vs. Static Conservation**

Traditional cultural preservation models, developed primarily for archaeological, crafts, and architectural contexts, emphasize conservation of existing artifacts and documentation of historical practices. This approach, rooted in western "museum culture", treats cultural objects as fixed entities requiring protection from change rather than as elements within ongoing living traditions that respond to new conditions and challenges.

The 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage marked a shift in this perspective by recognizing that cultural heritage extends beyond tangible things to include "identification, documentation, research, preservation, protection, promotion, enhancement, transmission" \citep{unesco2003}. More importantly, the convention defines intangible cultural heritage as something that is "constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment" \citep{unesco2003}, explicitly acknowledging its living, evolving nature.

However, this framework still emphasizes documenting and officially recognizing traditional practices rather than preserving communities' ability to adapt and change those practices. The UNESCO approach, while acknowledging living practices, still requires processes that tend to crystallize traditions into documentable forms rather than preserving their adaptive capacity, the quality that democratic fabrication systems must maintain to enable ongoing maker authority over creative processes.

**Cross-Cultural Models of Adaptive Preservation**

The static documentation approaches critiqued highly contrast with preservation practices across different cultural contexts that prioritize maintaining agency and adaptive capacity over material authenticity. These alternative models demonstrate how preservation can support the kind of ongoing democratic authority that participatory fabrication requires.

_Cuban Automobile Preservation: Functionality Through Adaptation_

Cuba's preservation of classic American automobiles exemplifies a functional preservation, the maintainance of cultural significance through continuous adaptation oposed to static conservation. Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution and subsequent U.S. embargo, Cubans maintained an estimated 60,000 classic American cars through creative adaptation. As the \citet{diplomatictimes2019} reports, "About half of the cars originate from the 1950s, while 25 percent are from the 1940s and another 25 percent are from the 1930s. A lot of them have been passed down from generation to generation, along with the mechanical genius."

These vehicles remain culturally significant not despite their modifications but because of them. Their external appearancespreserve historical recognition value while their internal systems have evolved into hybrid assemblages. "A common substitution on the old 1950s era cars on the island are diesel engines for the old straight-six or V-8 engines originally in the cars, due to diesel's lower cost on the island, and the better fuel efficiency of the engines," \citep{diplomatictimes2019} with "diesel engines from Russian trucks or boats" \citep{diplomatictimes2019} replacing original components.

This preservation approach prioritizesthe ongoing functionality and cultural continuity over "strict" tangible authenticity. The cars remain integrated within contemporary Cuban life, functioning as taxis and tourist attractions rather than museum pieces, showcasing preservation through active use rather than protection from use. As \citet{adewale2024} observes, "While some people might expect these old cars to be museum pieces, they're part of everyday life in Cuba."

_Māori River Preservation: Relational Continuity Through Legal Innovation_

New Zealand's legal recognition of the Whanganui River as a living entity with "the same rights and responsibilities as a person" \citep{paremata2017} exemplifies preservation through transformed conceptual frameworks rather than material conservation. This approach emerged from Māori understanding expressed in the saying "Ko au te awa, ko te awa ko au" (I am the river, and the river is me), where the river name "Awa Tupua" includes "the whole river system, its spirit, and the people that are related to it" \citep{nationallibrarynz2017}.

Rather than treating the river as a natural resource requiring protection through regulatory restriction, this model empowers the Māori to manage and protect the river based on their traditional ecological knowledge. As \citet{vijaykuma2019} notes, "As a consequence of this recognition, the Maori are now empowered to manage and protect the river based on their traditional ecological knowledge." Preservation here operates through maintaining relationships and ongoing interactions rather than controlling physical attributes or preventing change.

This relational approach recognizes that preservation must account for living connections between people, practices, and environments rather than treating cultural elements as discrete objects requiring isolation from contemporary influences.

_Implications for Inangible Knowledge Preservation_

These diverse preservation models highlight shared principles that might address the democratization challenges identified earlier. Both Cuban functional adaptation and Māori relational continuity prioritize process over product, relationships over artifacts, and adaptation over stasis. As \citet{munoz_zanon_2025} concludes from this analysis, effective preservation approaches should "capture process knowledge and decision-making rather than just final geometries, preserve the dynamic relationship between maker, material, and tool, and allow for adaptation and evolution rather than freezing techniques in time."

Taking a look at the fabrication democratization aspect, out of these principles it can be asummed that preserving makers' agency requires organizational structures that maintain what the Cuban model showcases: the capacity for ongoing functional adaptation in response to changing conditions. Similarly to the Māori approach, genuine fabrication democratization would preserve makers' collective authority to determine how systems evolve, maintaining the relational continuity between human intention and material response.

**Preservation as Structural Maintenance**

From this cross-cultural perspective, intangible knowledge preservation becomes analogous to ecological preservation, which maintains ecosystem health through preserving functional relationships rather than individual species populations. Just as ecological preservation focuses on maintaining the processes that enable ecosystem adaptation and resilience, intangible knowledge preservation would focus on maintaining the organizational structures that enable ongoing creative development.

Yet skilled making practices have always been evolutionary rather than static. Traditional craft knowledge developed through continuous adaptation to changing materials, tools, technologies, and cultural contexts. What characterized these traditions was not procedural fixity but adaptive capacity: the ability to maintain creative authority while responding to new conditions. As Cuban mechanics demonstrate through automotive adaptation and as Māori communities demonstrate through evolving river stewardship, living traditions preserve their essential character through responsive modification rather than rigid conservation.

This approach suggests that genuine preservation requires creating conditions where skilled making practices can continue developing rather than simply documenting how they currently operate. Current digital fabrication's focus on explicit documentation, tutorials, parametric models, procedural instructions that represent a "museum preservation" approach, an approach that captures surface manifestations while eliminating the underlying adaptive capacity that enabled those practices to develop historically.

**Dynamic Preservation as Democratic Practice**

The connection between preservation and democratization becomes apparent when examining how different preservation approaches distribute authority over cultural development. Static preservation concentrates interpretive authority within expert institutions that determine authentic forms and appropriate practices. Dynamic preservation, by contrast, maintains community authority over ongoing cultural adaptation, determining how traditions should evolve in response to changing conditions.

Cuban automobile preservation maintains community control over technological adaptation; Māori river stewardship preserves Indigenous authority over environmental relationship. Both models demonstrate how preservation can function as democratic practice that maintains cultural agency rather than transferring it to external conservation institutions.

Applied to digital fabrication, this can suggest that preservation-based democratization would focus on maintaining maker authority over creative adaptation rather than expanding access to predetermined fabrication procedures. Just as Cuban mechanics maintain automotive culture through responsive modification and Māori communities maintain river relationships through evolving stewardship practices, intangible knowledge preservation would need to maintain the adaptive authority that enables creative traditions to develop continuously in response to new technological possibilities.

This represents a "rupture" from current fabrication democratization approaches, which expand access to expert-designed systems while preserving the organizational structures that concentrate creative authority in separate design phases. True preservation-based democratization would require developing representational frameworks and workflow architectures that maintain creative agency throughout making processes, enabling the continuous dialogue between maker, material, and technology that has characterized living craft traditions in the past.

**Documentation as Process Preservation: Beyond Static Recording**

The preservation challenges extend into contemporary digital fabrication through documentation practices that undermine rather than support genuine democratization. While the previous analysis showed how both dynamic preservation and democratic participation require maintaining adaptive authority within ongoing practices, current fabrication documentation operates through the same technocratic representation that characterizes Schumpeterian democracy: enabling participation within predetermined procedures while eliminating authority over how those procedures operate.

Standard fabrication documentation (CAD files, parameter lists, step-by-step tutorials) exemplify this technocratic approach, functioning as expert-designed interfaces that mediate between human intention and material execution while eliminating opportunities for creative input beyond initial design specification. This documentation architecture perpetuates the distributed agency pattern traced in the first chapter of this research, concentrating decision-making authority in separate phases while rendering subsequent stages increasingly automated and non-responsive.

Yet examining documentation practices across different educational and experimental contexts reveals alternative approaches that align better with both the dynamic preservation principles demonstrated by Cuban mechanics, Māori river stewardship, and the participatory democratic theory that emphasizes learning through exercising authority. These case studies suggest different pathways toward documentation frameworks capable of supporting preservation-based democratization by maintaining the continuity of creative decision-making that characterizes unified agency, even within digital fabrication contexts.

**Educational Documentation as Process Preservation**

The FabAcademy and Fabricademy documentation sites provide compelling examples of documentation that captures learning processes rather than just technical outcomes. Unlike traditional technical manuals that present polished procedures, these educational platforms require students to document their entire learning journey, including failed experiments, debugging processes, and iterative refinements.

FabAcademy student documentation reveals the authentic progression of skill development through detailed weekly logs that include "what worked," "what didn't work," and "what I learned." Students document not only successful fabrication outcomes but also the problem-solving processes that led to those outcomes. A typical FabAcademy documentation entry might include: failed 3D print attempts with analysis of what caused the failure, iterative adjustments to printing parameters, and reflection on how material behavior differed from expectations.

This approach recognizes that learning fabrication skills requires experiencing and working through failures rather than simply following successful procedures. The documentation becomes a record of adaptive authority in action: students learning to modify their approaches based on material feedback, equipment limitations, and emergent discoveries.

Fabricademy extends this process-oriented documentation to textile and bio-material fabrication, where material unpredictability requires even greater adaptive capacity. Students document experiments with living materials, bacterial cultures, and organic dyes, processes where following predetermined procedures often fails, and creative adaptation becomes essential. The resulting documentation captures not just final recipes but the iterative process of material negotiation that characterizes traditional craft knowledge.

**Digital Workflows as Narrative Preservation**

Tran O'Leary et al.'s Tandem system represents another approach to process-oriented documentation, implementing entire fabrication workflows as computational notebooks that preserve the complete narrative of creation. Rather than abstracting away the making process into separate CAD/CAM phases, Tandem maintains continuity between design decisions and material execution through what the authors term "reproducible fabrication workflows." (2024)

Crucially, Tandem's approach acknowledges that reproduction is not repetition, each implementation of a workflow involves contextual adaptations based on available materials, equipment variations, and maker expertise. The system preserves decision-making authority by enabling users to modify workflow parameters while maintaining the underlying logical structure that connects intention to execution.

The Tandem approach showcases how digital documentation might preserve adaptive authority rather than eliminating it. By implementing workflows as modifiable programs rather than fixed procedures, the system enables a kind of "generative reproduction", a capacity to maintain creative agency while building on previous work. This represents a significant departure from standard CAD/CAM workflows that concentrate creative decisions in separate design phases while rendering material execution increasingly automated.

**The Paradox of Complete Documentation**

Yet even these progressive documentation approaches encounter fundamental limitations when attempting to capture the full complexity of skilled making processes. The challenge becomes apparent when examining machine learning and computer vision applications to craft preservation, as demonstrated by the AI.RTISANSHIP project's attempt to digitize traditional pottery techniques.

Contemporary digital fabrication has increasingly turned toward artificial intelligence and machine learning as potential solutions for preserving and transmitting craft knowledge. Neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures, promise to identify complex patterns in human movement that traditional documentation methods cannot capture. Computer vision systems like MediaPipe can track hundreds of body landmarks in real-time, while recurrent neural networks can process temporal sequences of movement data to classify skilled actions. The underlying assumption suggests that if these computational systems can analyze skilled movements with sufficient precision, they might decode the embodied knowledge that characterizes traditional making practices.

This technological optimism reflects broader cultural beliefs about algorithmic pattern recognition and data-driven knowledge extraction. Machine learning frameworks position themselves as universal decoders capable of discovering meaningful relationships within any sufficiently large dataset. Convolutional neural networks excel at visual pattern recognition, LSTM networks specialize in temporal sequence analysis, and ensemble methods combine multiple algorithmic approaches to maximize classification accuracy. Applied to craft preservation, these technologies "promise" to transform the slow, contextual transmission methods of traditional apprenticeship into efficient, scalable digital systems.

The machine learning pipeline for craft preservation typically follows established patterns: computer vision captures movement trajectories, feature extraction algorithms reduce high-dimensional data to manageable representations, supervised learning models train on labeled examples of "correct" and "incorrect" techniques, and real-time inference systems provide immediate feedback to learners. The computational promise appears compelling; rather than relying on years of mentorship under expert guidance, algorithmic systems could potentially democratize access to craft expertise through technological mediation.

However, as the AI.RTISANSHIP analysis revealed, the fundamental assumptions underlying these machine learning approaches may themselves be problematic. The attempt to preserve craft knowledge through computational pattern recognition creates a paradox: the more precisely algorithms attempt to measure and classify skilled practice, the more they reveal dimensions of that practice that resist algorithmic categorization. This suggests that the problem with craft preservation may not be inadequate machine learning architectures, but rather the conceptual framework that treats embodied knowledge as pattern data that can be extracted from its contextual matrix through computational analysis.

**Learning from Failure: The AI.RTISANSHIP Experiment and the Limits of Technical Preservation**

To investigate these limitations empirically, this research developed the AI.RTISANSHIP experiment, an attempt to capture and digitize traditional pottery techniques through computer vision and machine learning systems. The goal was to create a machine learning model capable of analyzing artisanal hand movements and providing real-time feedback on the correctness of performed actions, essentially functioning as a "digital master" for craft learning.

The experimental design employed MediaPipe computer vision framework for landmark detection, TensorFlow for neural network implementation, and a custom Flask web application for user interaction (detailed technical implementation available in Annex 1). The system captured hand and body movements during pottery throwing sessions, processed this data through a bidirectional LSTM neural network, and provided real-time visual feedback distinguishing between "correct" and "incorrect" movements through color-coded overlays.

**The Experiment: Digitizing Embodied Knowledge**

The AI.RTISANSHIP system made use of MediaPipe's holistic model to track 33 pose landmarks, 21 landmarks per hand, and facial features, generating 225-dimensional vectors for each frame of movement. The machine learning pipeline processed sequences of 30 frames (approximately one second of movement) through a three-layer bidirectional LSTM network with dropout regularization and L2 penalty terms to prevent overfitting.

Data collection involved recording multiple pottery throwing sessions, manually labeling movements as "correct" or "incorrect," and training the neural network to recognize these patterns. The system achieved a considerable accuracy in distinguishing between predefined movement categories, successfully identifying differences between throwing techniques and providing real-time classification through a web interface.

However, the technical "success" highlighted fundamental conceptual problems that became apparent only through extended testing with the potters.

**The Unmeasurable Dimensions of Craft Knowledge**

The experiment's conclusions revealed that craft knowledge operates through dimensions that systematically resist algorithmic capture. Computer vision could detect hand positions with great precision but remained blind to the tactile feedback that informed those positions, the subtle resistance of clay indicating proper centering, texture changes signaling optimal moisture content, or minute vibrations warning of impending collapse. These sensory channels, essential for skilled pottery practice, exist entirely outside the visual domain that computer vision systems can access.

Beyond sensory limitations, the experiment exposed deeper problems with the assumption that skilled practice follows standardizable patterns. Each participating artisan demonstrated fundamentally different approaches to identical pottery tasks, reflecting not just technical variations but deeply personal relationships with clay developed through years of individual practice. Where one potter relied on strong, decisive movements shaped by decades working with stoneware, another employed gentle, patient techniques developed through extensive porcelain experience. These differences stemmed not from varying levels of skill but from unique personal histories, physical capabilities, and aesthetic preferences that had developed into distinct making philosophies.

Most fundamentally, the machine learning system's requirement for binary classification, "correct" versus "incorrect", proved conceptually inappropriate for pottery practice. The participating potters consistently emphasized that successful throwing depends on continuous adaptation to emergent material conditions rather than adherence to predetermined techniques. Each clay body presents unique characteristics based on mineral composition, preparation methods, atmospheric conditions, and aging processes. Skilled practice involves real-time negotiation with these variables through intuition, accumulated sensitivity that enables appropriate responses to unprecedented situations. This adaptive capacity, which constitutes the essence of pottery expertise, cannot be reduced to pattern recognition algorithms that require standardized input categories.

**The Tacit Knowledge Barrier**

AI.RTISANSHIP aimed to identify the tacit dimension of knowledge in craft. The essential aspects of skilled practice that exist beyond explicit articulation. Traditional pottery throwing involves a negotiation between potter, clay, and environmental conditions. This negotiation operates through sensory channels that resist digitization: the feeling of clay resistance against fingertips, the sound of properly centered clay on the wheel, the visual assessment of wall thickness through clay translucency.

Even beyond that, the experiment exposed a contextual responsiveness in craft, showing the capacity to modify technique continuously based on emergent material conditions. Each piece of clay presenting unique characteristics based on its preparation, moisture, and mineral composition. Skilled potters develop sensitivity to these variations through accumulated experience, enabling real-time adaptation that optimizes technique for specific material conditions.

The machine learning system developed, by contrast, required standardized input data and produced standardized classifications. This architectural constraint eliminated precisely the adaptive responsiveness that characterizes skilled practice. Where pottery expertise emerges from continuous dialogue between maker and material, the AI system imposed predetermined categories that prevented such dialogue.

**The Feedback Problem**

The real-time feedback mechanism (color-coded overlays indicating "correct" or "incorrect" movements) created additional problems that highlighted the inadequacy of the technological approach. Experienced potters reported that the visual feedback disrupted their attention to tactile and auditory cues essential for successful throwing. The system's focus on visual movement patterns diverted attention from the sensory channels through which pottery expertise actually operates.

Furthermore, the feedback timing proved problematic. Machine learning classification occurred with slight delays (200-300 milliseconds) that broke the immediate feedback loops characterizing skilled practice. Pottery throwing requires instantaneous responses to material conditions, but the computational processing introduced temporal gaps that made the feedback irrelevant to the ongoing throwing process.

The binary feedback categories also proved counterproductive for learning. Rather than developing sensitivity to material conditions, test users began focusing on reproducing movements that triggered "correct" classifications, regardless of whether those movements were appropriate for their specific contextual conditions. The system incentivized mechanical reproduction over the adaptive responsiveness.

**Implications for Digital Fabrication Preservation**

The experiment's limitations highlight broader problems with computational approaches to craft preservation. The attempt to extract explicit rules from embodied practices assumes that skilled knowledge can be decomposed into discrete, transferable components. Yet the experiment demonstrated that pottery expertise exists not in specific movements but in the capacity for contextual adaptation, precisely what the machine learning system eliminated through its requirement for standardized classifications.

Out of these findings, it is possible to suggest that effective craft preservation cannot operate through documentation technologies that abstract away material context and environmental variation. Cuban automobile preservation succeeds not because it captures standardized procedures but because it maintains the conditions for ongoing adaptive problem-solving. Māori river stewardship preserves cultural relationships not through fixed protocols but through continued community engagement with changing environmental conditions.

Similarly, effective digital fabrication preservation would need to maintain the conditions for adaptive response rather than capturing standardized procedures. This represents a fundamental shift from documentation-based approaches towards an "ecological preservation" that maintains the organizational structures that enable ongoing creative adaptation within technological contexts.

**Beyond Documentation: Toward Ecological Preservation**

Experiment's limitations do not suggest abandoning documentation altogether, but rather reconceptualizing what documentation means within embodied knowledge preservation contexts. Documentation remains essential, but it must acknowledge that each implementation of documented knowledge will necessarily differ based on contextual variables, material conditions, and individual practitioner characteristics.

Rather than attempting to capture universal techniques through computational standardization, effective preservation requires documentation frameworks that explicitly account for contextual variation. This involves creating technological environments that preserve not just movement patterns but the decision-making processes that inform adaptive responses to changing conditions. Such systems would document the reasoning behind technical choices, the environmental factors that influence material behavior, and the range of acceptable variations rather than singular "correct" procedures.

This contextual approach to documentation would treat preservation not as knowledge capture but as the maintenance of conditions for ongoing creative adaptation. Digital fabrication systems designed according to these principles would preserve material feedback channels, enable real-time modification based on emergent conditions, and maintain maker authority over creative decisions throughout the fabrication process. Documentation would function as a scaffold for contextual learning rather than a template for mechanical reproduction.

The following chapters will explore how such contextually-aware preservation might operate within digital fabrication workflows, building on the AI.RTISANSHIP experiment's insights to develop concrete approaches for preserving adaptive capacity within technological systems while acknowledging that each creative implementation will necessarily reflect the unique intersection of maker, material, and circumstance.

**Chapter 3: From Theory to Practice - Experimental Pathways**

_"If craftsmanship's essence lies in the creative problem solving process, how can digital fabrication tools become active participants in it rather than automation devices?"_

The theoretical framework developed in the previous chapters suggested that genuine democratization of digital fabrication requires preservation-based approaches that maintain adaptive authority rather than simply expanding access to predetermined tools. Yet this analysis raised fundamental questions about implementation: How might such preservation actually operate within existing technological contexts? Could alternative interface designs bridge the gap between computational precision and embodied creative processes? The following experimental investigations sought to address these questions through practical interventions that tested the theoretical propositions in real-world making contexts.

This chapter will document three "interventions" that progressively refined approaches to preserving intangible knowledge within digital fabrication workflows. Each experiment built upon insights from the previous, ultimately leading to the development of Ars Post Faber, the open-source Grasshopper plugin that embodies the research's theoretical conclusions.

**3.1 CR3ATED: Reimagining CAD Interfaces for Artisan Expression**

**Exploring Alternative Interface Approaches**

Building upon insights from AI.RTISANSHIP, the question emerged: what if digital tools could be designed to better support the adaptive decision-making processes that characterize skilled practice? This inquiry led to the development of CR3ATED, a web-based application designed to test alternative interface approaches within digital fabrication workflows.

The CR3ATED experiment was conceived to investigate whether different modes of human-software interaction could preserve creative agency while engaging with digital fabrication technologies. Rather than accepting conventional CAD interfaces as inevitable, the experiment sought to explore how interface design affects the preservation of adaptive authority throughout making processes.

**Craftinnova: Testing Alternative Interfaces**

The CR3ATED web application was developed specifically for the "Nuevos Métodos de Aprendizaje Artesano" workshop at CRAFTINNOVA, creating an opportunity to test alternative interface approaches with practicing artisans in a real fabrication context. The workshop brought together traditional craftspeople with clay 3D printing technology, creating a natural laboratory for investigating how interface design affects the preservation of creative agency.

Rather than using conventional CAD software, CR3ATED implemented a touch-based sketching interface that allowed participants to create 3D models through direct manipulation on mobile devices. The application translated 2D sketches into revolution surfaces suitable for clay printing, maintaining the intuitive hand-to-head connection that characterizes traditional pottery practice while engaging with digital fabrication capabilities.

This approach acknowledged a fundamental insight from the theoretical analysis: conventional CAD systems fail to express the imperfection and responsiveness that characterize craft practice. By creating a workflow that began with tactile sketching and culminated in material engagement, the experiment explored how technology might contribute to craft preservation not merely through documentation, but by becoming integrated into evolving creative practice.

**Material Continuity and Digital Mediation**

An important aspect of the CR3ATED workflow involved preserving material continuity between digital design and physical fabrication. The clay printer, despite its digital control system, interacts with clay according to the same physical principles that govern hand techniques. Clay maintains its material properties regardless of whether it is shaped by hand or extruded through a mechanical nozzle, maintaining material coherence across the digital/physical boundary.

This materiality creates productive constraints rather than arbitrary limitations. Workshop participants encountered the clay printer's capabilities and limitations as a new set of material conditions to navigate, drawing on their traditional knowledge while developing new skills specific to the printer. Unlike conventional CAD/CAM workflows that abstract away material properties through geometric representation, the CR3ATED approach maintained material feedback throughout the process.

The touch interface proved to be important for preserving this material relationship. Whereas conventional CAD requires learning abstract geometric manipulation techniques, sketching with the finger or a stylus maintains the tactile connection between hand movement and form development. Participants of the workshop were able to leverage their existing drawing skills while engaging with digital fabrication, rather than having to master entirely new representational systems.

**Artisan Responses: Expanding vs. Replacing Practice**

The workshop generated diverse responses from the participants, showing different ways that digital tools might relate to traditional practice. For some participants, the clay printing process represented a novel exploration rather than a fundamental shift in approach. These artisans engaged with the technology as they might with any new tool or technique, integrating it within their existing practice without any conceptual disruption.

However, other participants experienced the workshop as expanding their literacy in both digital and material domains by creating new interactions between artisan, material, and tool. For these makers, the CR3ATED interface enabled forms of creative expression that would have been difficult (or impossible) to achieve through either traditional hand-building or conventional CAD approaches.

Significantly, the workshop attempted to challenge the binary thinking that has characterized discussions of technology and craft since the Industrial Revolution. Rather than framing hand-building versus digital printing as competing methodologies, the comparison between techniques became "an exploration of their complementary strengths" rather than a contest between "superior" and "inferior" approaches.

This finding aligns with Gershenfeld's vision of personal fabrication enabling the convergence of industrial production with personal expression, "which would merge with digital design, to bring common sense and sensibility to the creation and application of advanced technologies" (Gershenfeld, 2007). The clay printer became not merely a tool but a participant in creative dialogue, presenting its own challenges and possibilities while requiring new skills that built upon rather than replaced traditional knowledge.

**The Expression Constraint: Success and Limitations**

Despite the "success" in exploring a new way of interaction and preserving material relationships, the CR3ATED highlighted certain limitations that pointed toward the need for more sophisticated interventions. While the touch-based sketching approach built upon CAD's geometric constraints, it remained limited to revolution forms suitable for lathe operations. Participants could only create objects that could be generated by rotating a 2D profile around an axis.

More significantly, the simplification required to make the interface accessible to users with no CAD experience eliminated many of the adaptive capabilities that characterize both traditional craft and sophisticated digital design. The application could capture the gestural intent of sketching, but it could not accommodate the complex modifications and iterative refinements that enabled to respond to emerging contexts.

This constraint highlighted the biggest inconvenience of this research: tools simple enough for broad accessibility may lack the expressive range needed to preserve adaptive authority, while tools sophisticated enough to support complex creative decision-making may require technical expertise that creates new barriers to access.

**Implications: The Simplification Constraint Problem**

CR3ATED experiment's most significant insight emerged from recognizing that its limitations were not inherent to alternative interface design, but specific to the simplified application context. While the experiment successfully showcased more intuitive approaches to digital fabrication interface design, it also revealed constraints imposed by simplification strategies commonly employed in educational contexts.

This finding can be contextualized within broader research on digital fabrication in educational environments. Studies reveal that "focus on the potentials of these technologies has mainly been on the support to STEM oriented learning goals" (Smith & Iversen, 2016). At the same time, research specifically examining tools like TinkerCAD shows that while such platforms enable users to "easily build a virtual model and make it tangible," participants consistently recognize "challenges in the use of these technological resources" particularly around creative expression and adaptive modification (Barbosa et al., 2024).

This recognition led to a realization; rather than creating new simplified tools that inevitably constrain expression, preservation-based democratization might be better achieved by developing more human-centered ways of interacting with sophisticated tools that people already know and use. Professional CAD environments possess the computational sophistication needed to support complex creative decision-making, but their interfaces often fail to support the fluid, responsive workflows that characterize unified agency.

The workshop participants' responses reinforced this insight. Those who engaged most successfully with the digital fabrication process were able to foresee how to integrate it within their existing creative frameworks. This suggested that effective preservation requires tools that augment rather than substitute for existing craft knowledge, maintaining the conditions for adaptive response while leveraging contemporary technological capabilities.

**Toward Integrated Solutions**

CR3ATED established several principles for preservation-based fabrication democratization:

-Touch-based interfaces can maintain the hand-to-head connection essential for intuitive creative practice.

- Material continuity between digital design and physical fabrication preserves the feedback loops that enable adaptive response.

- Alternative interface approaches can successfully challenge the geometric constraints imposed by conventional CAD simplification.

Yet the experiment also revealed that democratization through simplified standalone applications, while valuable for initial access and exploration, may be insufficient for supporting the complex creative processes that characterize skilled making practice. The most promising pathway appeared to lie in developing more human-centered approaches to sophisticated tools rather than creating new simplified tools with constrained capabilities.

This insight points toward the development of plugins and extensions for existing professional CAD environments rather than standalone applications. The following experiments would build upon these insights while addressing its expressive limitations through integration with more powerful computational design platforms.

The transition from simplified applications to sophisticated CAD environments marks a shift in this research approach. Preservation of craft agency requires not just accessible interfaces but representational frameworks and workflow architectures capable of supporting the full complexity of creative decision-making processes.

**3.2 AI Explorations: Large Language Models as Creative Collaborators**

Following the insights gained from the executed interventions, which revealed the constraints inherent in simplified touch-based interfaces and the need to find newer ways of human-software-machine interactions that could be embedded in traditional CAD environments, the research shifted toward exploring these new ways of interacting, specifically language itself as a medium for human-software-machine interaction. _Could natural language bridge the gap between creative intention and computational execution, preserving the fluid dialogue between maker and material while leveraging the computational sophistication needed for complex creative processes?_

While CR3ATED had demonstrated the importance of interactive interfaces, it had also shown that simplification strategies inevitably constrained creative expression. Language, as humanity's most sophisticated tool for expressing complex, nuanced, and contextual ideas, presented a promising pathway to both geometric manipulation and simplified graphical interfaces.

The exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) proceeded through two interconnected experiments that investigated different aspects of language-mediated creative interaction. First, AI Tools explored how natural language could serve as an input mechanism for generating 3D content and extracting design information from visual references. Second, the component that makes, investigated how conversational interaction could transform the CAD environment itself, enabling makers to dynamically extend their computational workflows capabilities through linguistic description.

**Language as Creative Medium**

Traditional CAD interfaces require users to translate creative intentions through geometric operations, parametric relationships, and mathematical constraints. This translation process, while powerful for precise control, creates barriers between conceptual thinking and execution. The maker must learn not only to envision forms but to decompose those visions into the logical sequences required by software interfaces. This translation represents another form of the conception-execution separation that this research has previously identified as problematic in order to achieve unified agency.

Natural language offers a different approach to human-software interaction. Rather than requiring makers to adapt their thinking to software logic, language-based interfaces enable software to interpret human expression in its natural form. This represents a potential reversal of the historical trend toward increasingly abstract interfaces that distance makers from their creative intentions.

However, the integration of language into digital fabrication workflows raises complex questions about creative agency and technological mediation. Language, while natural for human expression, must still be interpreted and translated by computational systems. The risk emerges that linguistic interfaces might simply create new forms of abstraction, where makers lose control over how their intentions are interpreted and implemented by AI systems.

**AI Tools: Natural Language as Input Mechanism**

The AI Tools plugin investigated how natural language could function as an input mechanism for generating 3D content within existing Grasshopper workflows. The text-to-CAD component enabled makers to describe desired objects in everyday language, receiving geometrically precise 3D models suitable for fabrication. Prompts like "Design a LEGO module with four connectors" or "Create a bracket for mounting a sensor" generated specific geometries that could be immediately integrated into larger parametric designs.

This approach demonstrated several advantages over traditional geometric modeling. First, it enabled rapid exploration of form concepts without requiring detailed knowledge of 3D modeling techniques. Makers could iterate through multiple design variations by modifying textual descriptions rather than reconstructing geometric relationships. Second, it provided access to complex geometries that might be difficult or time-consuming to model manually, expanding the vocabulary of forms available within design workflows.

The image-to-prompt component extended this linguistic approach by enabling visual references to be translated into textual descriptions. Makers could upload photographs, sketches, or existing objects to generate detailed natural language descriptions suitable for feeding into the text-to-CAD workflow. This created a multimodal conversation where visual, textual, and geometric representations could be fluidly translated between each other.

However, the AI Tools experiment also revealed certain limitations in treating language as simply another input mechanism. While natural language enables more intuitive specification of design intentions, the AI system's interpretation of those intentions operates through opaque training processes whose biases and assumptions remain unknown to makers. More critically, the delivery of fully-formed 3D models as outputs eliminates the very obstacles, negotiations, and material resistances that constitute the essence of making experience. By providing immediate geometric solutions, the system bypasses the iterative problem-solving, material dialogue, and adaptive decision-making that enable makers to develop embodied knowledge and maintain creative agency throughout the making process. This creates a form of "creative short-circuiting" where technological efficiency undermines the experiential foundations of skilled practice, replacing the continuous negotiation between intention and material reality with predetermined computational outcomes.

**The Component That Makes: Conversational Tool Building**

On the other hand, the Component that Makes represents a more radical exploration of language-mediated interaction, investigating how natural language could be used not just to generate predetermined content but to modify the computational environment itself. Rather than providing predetermined functionality, the system enables makers to describe needed capabilities and receive custom-generated Grasshopper components that become permanent additions to their creative toolkit.

This approach transforms language from an input mechanism into a medium for collaborative tool building. Makers can request components like "Create a tool that distributes objects along a curve with random rotation" or "Generate a component that analyzes mesh topology and identifies polygon concentration points." The AI system will generate, compile, and install custom C# components that provide exactly the specified functionality, enabling makers to expand their computational vocabulary through conversational interaction.

The component generator showcased several points of interest in language-mediated creative interaction. First, it preserved transparency by providing complete generated source code alongside functional components, enabling makers to understand and modify AI-generated solutions. Second, it enabled iterative refinement through follow-up requests that built upon previous components, creating conversational workflows where computational tools emerged through dialogue rather than predetermined design. Third, it incorporated contextual knowledge from technical documentation, enabling AI responses that referenced established programming patterns while addressing specific creative requirements.

Most significantly, the component generator treated the Grasshopper canvas itself as a form of collaborative documentation. Each generated component preserved not just a computational solution but a record of the conversational process through which that solution emerged. The component's parameters, connections, and modifications documented an ongoing dialogue between human creative intentions and AI computational interpretation, creating a conversational artifact that embedded linguistic interaction within workflows.

**Toward Integrated Human-Software-Machine Dialogue**

The AI explorations demonstrated that large language models could serve as powerful mediators for expanding human-software-machine interactions, but also revealed the critical importance of how these capabilities are deployed within creative workflows. The experiments and their testing showed that LLMs have remarkable potential for bridging between natural human expression and computational implementation, yet their application requires careful consideration of how they affect creative agency and skill development.

The key distinction emerged between AI applications that automate creative processes versus those that expand creative capabilities. Tools like the text-to-CAD component, while impressive in their technical capabilities, ultimately diminished maker agency by delivering predetermined solutions that bypassed the iterative problem-solving and material dialogue essential to skilled practice. These approaches constrained creative exploration to the patterns encoded within training data while eliminating the obstacles and negotiations that enable makers to develop embodied knowledge and adaptive responses.

In contrast, the component generator approach suggested more promising directions by functioning as a transparent documentation tool that expanded rather than replaced human creative capabilities. By generating custom computational tools that became permanent additions to the maker's vocabulary, this approach preserved creative agency while leveraging AI capabilities to bridge between linguistic expression and technical implementation. The system's transparency enabled makers to understand and modify generated solutions, while its persistent documentation captured the reasoning behind creative decisions for future adaptation and collaborative development.

Most significantly, these experiments revealed that language-mediated interaction could address the simplification constraints that had limited previous interface explorations while providing access to sophisticated computational capabilities. Rather than requiring makers to adapt their thinking to predetermined software logic, conversational interfaces enable creative intention to be expressed in natural human terms while maintaining the computational sophistication needed for complex creative processes.

However, the explorations also highlighted that language alone cannot resolve all challenges of preserving creative agency within digital fabrication contexts. The inherent ambiguity of natural language, its limitations in capturing embodied knowledge, and AI systems' dependence on existing training patterns point towards the need for more comprehensive approaches that integrate linguistic interaction with other forms of creative expression and material feedback.

**Synthesizing Insights for Unified Agency**

The experimental progression from CR3ATED's interfacing exploration through AI Tools' service integration to the Component that Makes' collaborative documentation highlight a clear trajectory toward more sophisticated approaches to human-software-machine interaction. Each experiment contributing essential insights: the importance of interfaces that preserve material relationships, the potential of linguistic mediation for expanding creative expression, and the critical distinction between automation that diminishes agency versus collaboration that enhances creative capabilities.

These findings converge on the following statement: Effective preservation-based democratization requires not individual tools or techniques, but integrated frameworks that combine multiple modes of creative expression within unified workflows. The challenge lies in developing systems that can seamlessly integrate conversational interaction, parametric manipulation, material feedback, and fabrication execution while preserving the continuous dialogue between maker and material that characterizes unified agency.

**Chapter 4: Ars Post Faber: Towards Unified Digital Agency**

_The craftsperson's relationship with their tools shapes not only what they make, but how they think about making itself._

The theoretical framework developed in the previous chapters culminates in a practical question: How might digital design tools be restructured to preserve the continuous dialogue between maker, material, and machine that characterizes unified agency? This chapter documents the development of Ars Post Faber, an open-source Grasshopper plugin that attempts to bridge the gap between the conception-execution separation identified in contemporary CAD/CAM workflows and the integrated practice advocated by this research.

**4.1 From Theory to Implementation: Design Philosophy**

The transition from theoretical analysis to practical implementation required confronting a fundamental paradox: how to create sophisticated computational tools while preserving the adaptive authority and embodied decision-making that enable makers to maintain creative control throughout the fabrication process. Rather than developing another standalone application with predetermined functionality, Ars Post Faber operates as an extension to existing professional CAD environments, specifically Grasshopper within Rhinoceros 3D, leveraging the computational sophistication needed for complex creative processes while introducing more human-centered approaches to interaction.

This strategic decision reflects the insight gained from the CR3ATED intervention: that democratization through simplified tools, while valuable for initial access, may be insufficient for supporting the full complexity of creative processes that characterize skilled making practice. By working within established professional environments, Ars Post Faber can maintain the representational sophistication necessary for "advanced" fabrication while introducing alternative interaction paradigms that support rather than replace existing craft knowledge.

**4.1.1 Open Source Foundation and MIT License**

Ars Post Faber is released under the MIT License, representing a commitment to genuine democratization through open access rather than merely expanded tool availability. The choice of MIT licensing reflects the research's broader argument that preservation-based democratization requires maintaining community authority over technological development rather than concentrating it within proprietary systems.

The MIT License enables users to:

- Use the software for any purpose, including commercial applications
- Modify and distribute the source code freely
- Create derivative works without restriction
- Integrate components into larger fabrication workflows

This licensing approach aligns with the preservation principles identified in Chapter 2, where Cuban automotive adaptation and Māori river stewardship showcased how living traditions maintain their essential character through community-controlled evolution rather than expert-managed conservation. By ensuring that fabrication tools remain modifiable and extensible, the MIT License enables the community to continuously build upon and expand the software, making preservation-based democratization more accessible. Rather than locking fabrication capabilities within proprietary systems that require expert mediation, the open source model empowers makers to adapt, extend, and share improvements that reflect their evolving creative needs and technological contexts.

**4.1.2 Plugin Architecture and Grasshopper Integration**

The plugin architecture operates through a computational augmentation rather than automation. Each component functions as a mediator that expands human creative capabilities while preserving decision-making authority throughout the fabrication process. This approach contrasts with traditional CAD/CAM systems that abstract away creative agency through predetermined workflow structures.

The integration with Grasshopper leverages the platform's node-based visual programming environment to maintain transparency in computational processes. Unlike black-box systems that hide their operational logic, Grasshopper's visual programming approach enables makers to understand, modify, and extend the computational relationships that connect design intentions with fabrication outcomes. This transparency supports the kind of adaptive authority identified as essential for unified agency.

**4.2 Component Ecosystem: Bridging Design and Fabrication**

The Ars Post Faber ecosystem comprises several interconnected component families, each addressing different aspects of the conception-execution separation while maintaining workflow continuity. Rather than organizing components around technical categories, they are structured according to the creative decision-making processes they support, reflecting the research's emphasis on preserving maker agency rather than maximizing technical efficiency.

**4.2.1 Large Language Model Integration: Conversational Tool Building**

The LLM components represent the direct implementation of language-mediated creative interaction explored in Chapter 3. These components transform natural language from a communication medium into a tool-building interface, enabling makers to extend their computational vocabulary through conversational interaction rather than predetermined functionality.

**OpenAI Component that Makes**

The OpenAI Component that Makes tries to explore how conversational interaction can reduce the gap between creative intention and technical implementation while maintaining transparency and user control. Unlike the text-to-CAD approaches that were identified as problematic for eliminating the iterative problem-solving essential to skill development, this component functions as a collaborative documentation tool.

The component operates through an agent-based approach that distinguishes between automation versus collaboration. When makers describe desired functionality in natural language, the system generates custom Grasshopper components that become permanent additions to their creative toolkit. Besides this, the system provides complete source code alongside functional components, enabling makers to understand and modify AI-generated solutions according to their specific needs.

The compilation process exemplifies the research's emphasis on preserving adaptive authority. Rather than delivering predetermined solutions, the system generates tools that makers can iteratively refine through multiple compilation attempts. Each failed compilation becomes a learning opportunity, with the AI system providing sophisticated solutions based on accumulated error feedback. This iterative approach maintains a material dialogue, where obstacles and resistances become integral components of skill development.

**Ollama Local Model Component that Makes**

The Component that Makes extends conversational tool building to local AI models, addressing concerns about creative dependency on external services while maintaining the collaborative advantages of language-mediated interaction. This approach reflects the research's emphasis on community control over technological development, enabling makers to maintain autonomy over their creative tools without requiring constant network connectivity or subscription services.

The local model integration demonstrates how democratization can operate through technological self-sufficiency rather than simply expanded access to centralized services. By supporting models that run entirely on local hardware, the component preserves the kind of community autonomy that characterized successful preservation examples like Cuban automotive adaptation, where creative control remained within local communities rather than being outsourced to external expertise.

**PDF Context Integration and Documentation as Process Preservation**

Both LLM components incorporate PDF context extraction capabilities that reflect the research's understanding of documentation as process preservation rather than static recording. Rather than simply indexing technical manuals, the context extraction system analyzes coding documentation, component examples, and fabrication guides to provide relevant knowledge that supports creative decision-making without predetermined outcomes.

The context management system operates through relevance scoring that prioritizes information based on the maker's specific creative intentions rather than predetermined categories. This approach treats documentation as a living resource that adapts to changing creative contexts rather than a fixed reference that constrains creative possibilities. The system can process multiple PDFs simultaneously, building comprehensive knowledge bases that evolve with the maker's developing expertise and changing project requirements.

**4.2.2 Serial Control: Bridging Digital Design and Physical Fabrication**

The Serial Control component represents the most direct implementation of the research's goal to eliminate the conception-execution separation. By maintaining continuous communication between design software and fabrication equipment, this component enables the kind of responsive modification that traditional craftspeople exercised through direct material manipulation.

**Cross-Platform Serial Communication**

The component implements cross-platform serial communication that addresses the technical complexity of connecting design software with fabrication equipment across different operating systems. Rather than requiring makers to adapt their creative process to technical limitations, the component handles the complexity of serial protocols while maintaining simple user interfaces.

The Windows implementation utilizes the RJCP SerialPortStream library for robust communication with USB-connected devices, while the macOS implementation operates through direct file system access combined with stty configuration for optimal performance. This dual approach ensures reliable communication regardless of platform while maintaining the real-time responsiveness necessary for interactive fabrication control.

**Real-Time G-Code Streaming and Buffer Management**

The streaming implementation tries to show how technical capabilities can support rather than complicate creative practice. The component manages printer buffer states automatically, sending commands at optimal intervals to maintain smooth motion while preventing buffer overflow that could interrupt fabrication sequences.

The buffer management system implements a sliding window approach that tracks acknowledgment responses from fabrication equipment, enabling optimal command throughput while maintaining error recovery capabilities. This technical implementation operates transparently, enabling makers to focus on creative decisions rather than communication protocols while ensuring reliable fabrication execution.

**Interactive Path Editing and Preview**

Perhaps most significantly, the Serial Control component incorporates interactive path editing capabilities that enable real-time modification of fabrication sequences even during active printing. The preview system generates three-dimensional visualizations of toolpaths that distinguish between completed, current, and upcoming fabrication segments, providing immediate visual feedback about fabrication progress and remaining work.

The path editing interface enables makers to modify upcoming toolpath segments through direct manipulation, highlighting how digital tools can preserve the adaptive authority. Makers can select and move individual path points or groups of points, with changes immediately reflected in both the visual preview and the G-code commands sent to fabrication equipment.

This capability represents a step away from traditional CAD/CAM workflows that lock design decisions during the manufacturing phases. By enabling modification throughout the this process, the component maintains the dialogue intention-execution.

**4.2.3 Slicer: Computational Fabrication with Craft Sensibility**

The decision to develop a custom slicer from scratch, rather than integrating existing solutions, emerged from the specific requirements of the integrated workflow approach. While established slicers offer comprehensive feature sets, they present significant challenges for live fabrication control: their complex parameter structures, and processing pipelines, make real-time modification during printing not that practical. A custom implementation allows for streamlined parameter management and direct integration with the Serial Control component's live editing capabilities.

**Simplified Settings Management**

The SlicerSettings component deliberately reduces the overwhelming parameter complexity that characterizes "commercial" slicers. Rather than exposing hundreds of settings that require great knowledge to configure effectively, the component focuses on parameters that directly impact the maker's creative control during fabrication. This simplification enables rapid iteration and real-time adjustment without requiring deep technical expertise in printer firmware or materials behaviour.

The component manages essential parameters: layer height, shell configurations, infill density, and motion speeds, while providing advanced options like arc interpolation and adaptive feed rates for more experienced users, prioritizing creative responsiveness over technical completeness.

**Streamlined Geometric Processing**

The SliceGeometry component processes three-dimensional geometry into fabrication layers with simplicity, focusing on reliable geometric conversion rather than exotic feature support. As an example, the automatic bed centering and straightforward layer generation prioritize consistent results that integrate seamlessly with live editing workflows.

This streamlined approach trades some advanced geometric capabilities for predictable behavior that supports real-time modification. When makers adjust paths during printing through the Serial Control interface, the simplified geometric processing ensures that modifications translate reliably into machine commands *without unexpected artifacts or failures.

**Integrated Infill Generation**

The ShellGeometry and InfillGeometry components implement basic infill algorithms that provide structural integrity while remaining computationally efficient enough for real-time recalculation. Rather than competing with more sophisticated infill patterns and support generation available in commercial slicers, these components focus on generating clean, modifiable toolpaths that support the live editing workflow.

**G-Code Generation for Live Control**

The GCodeGenerator component transforms geometric descriptions into machine commands while maintaining the possibility for real-time adjustment during fabrication. Traditional slicers generate complete G-code files that are then sent to printers as fixed sequences, making any modification impossible once printing begins. This component instead creates G-code designed to work seamlessly with the Serial Control component's live editing capabilities.

The generator incorporates arc interpolation and path smoothing to create flowing motion sequences that reflect the continuous nature of hand techniques rather than the choppy, segmented movements typical of naive geometric conversion. More importantly, the generated code maintains a structure that allows the Serial Control component to modify upcoming toolpaths on-the-fly, when makers adjust paths during printing through the preview interface, only the affected portions need recalculation rather than regenerating the entire toolpath. This enables the kind of responsive adaptation that traditional craftspeople exercise when they modify their approach based on how the work is developing.

**4.2.4 Mesh Editing and Hand Tracking: Embodied Digital Manipulation**

The mesh editing components explore how digital tools can preserve the tactile intelligence develop through direct material engagement. Rather than treating three-dimensional editing as a purely computational problem, these components investigate whether digital interfaces can maintain the spatial reasoning and responsive feedback that characterize skilled hand manipulation.

**Cross-Platform Mesh Editing Interface**

The MeshEditComponent tests whether three-dimensional editing can preserve the embodied knowledge that craftspeople develop through traditional making practice. The interface enables vertex selection and real-time deformation while providing immediate visual feedback, looking how digital manipulation might maintain the spatial understanding from direct material engagement.

By utilizing Eto.Forms for cross-platform consistency, the component ensures that this embodied digital interaction remains accessible across different systems, supporting the research's commitment to democratization through genuine accessibility rather than platform exclusivity.

**Computer Vision Hand Tracking Integration**

The experimental hand tracking capabilities integrated look to extend traditional craft techniques into digital domains. Using MediaPipe frameworks, the component interprets hand gestures as manipulation commands, testing whether direct spatial interaction with digital geometry can preserve the hand-to-material relationship that characterizes traditional craft.

This experiment in gestural interaction explores whether emerging technologies can enhance rather than replace the body knowledge that developed through repeated physical engagement, investigating new possibilities for maintaining this physical in computational environments.

**Material Constraint and Fabrication Awareness**

The incorporation of fabrication constraints directly into the editing process tests whether creative freedom emerges from understanding and working within material limitations rather than eliminating them entirely. The component prevents modifications that exceed fabrication capabilities while enabling exploration within realistic constraints.

**4.2.5 Photogrammetry Integration: Bridging Physical and Digital**

The Photogrammetry component created, explores how computational techniques might support the transmission of physical knowledge, addressing the challenge of incorporating embodied knowledge held within physical objects into digital fabrication workflows without requiring specialized expertise or expensive equipment.

**Mobile-First Capture Interface**

This photogrammetry component was designed to make three-dimensional scanning accessible to anyone with a smartphone, eliminating the traditional barriers that have kept 3D capture within "specialized" domains. Rather than requiring LIDAR scanners or photogrammetry rigs, makers can simply use their phone's camera to capture objects and immediately bring them into computational design workflows.

The web-based interface connects through QR codes, allowing instant access without app downloads or complex setup procedures. This approach reflects a principle of the research; that part of the democratization happens when sophisticated capabilities become as easy to access as taking a photograph, rather than requiring specialized knowledge or equipment.

**Real-Time Processing and Rhino Integration**

The component leverages Apple's RealityKit PhotogrammetrySession to perform 3D reconstruction directly on the device, then automatically imports the resulting models into the active Grasshopper workflow. This integration means that physical objects can move easily from the real world into computational design environments.

This direct pipeline from physical scanning to parametric modeling enables hybrid workflows where makers can capture existing objects, modify them computationally, and design/manufacture new variations combining both physical and digital techniques.

**4.3 Workflow Integration: From Concept to CAD to CAM**

The real goal of Ars Post Faber lies not in individual component capabilities but in their integration as a flexible ecosystem that preserves creative agency from initial conception through final fabrication.

Rather than prescribing a single workflow, these components can integrate at any point in the design process depending on the maker's CAD experience, physical experience and specific project needs. An experienced Grasshopper user might begin with parametric modeling and later introduce conversational tool building to extend their computational "vocabulary", while someone more comfortable with physical processes might start with photogrammetry capture or hand-drawn sketches and gradually incorporate computational design elements.

This modularity means makers can leverage the precision and computational capabilities of professional CAD environments while integrating more intuitive interaction methods where they provide the most value. The components function as bridges between different ways of thinking about form and making, rather than replacing existing knowledge with predetermined workflows. A traditional craftsperson can maintain their material intuition while accessing computational precision, while a technical designer can incorporate gestural expression without abandoning parametric control.

**4.4 Open Source Impact and Future Extensions**

The MIT License release represents both a technical contribution and a statement of intentions about technological democratization. By ensuring tools remain modifiable and extensible, the open source approach enables community-driven development that reflects diverse creative needs rather than market needs. This preserves the adaptive capacity essential for creative traditions to evolve continuously with changing technological possibilities.

Future development will focus on comprehensive source code documentation and user guidance to support community contribution and extension. Testing will expand beyond 3D printing to include CNC machining, laser cutting, and other fabrication modalities to validate the broader applicability of these interaction approaches. Most importantly, ongoing dialogue with test users might guide the development of new input components and interaction methods. The question to answer in this research remains whether this proposed way of making actually enhances creative practice or simply adds technological complexity. Only community engagement will be able to determine which aspects of the ones proposed genuinely support unified agency versus those that merely represent novel but ultimately superficial interactions with digital fabrication systems.

**Chapter 5: Conclusion. Questioning the Future of Human-Machine Interaction**

_"The future of making lies not in perfecting our machines, but in reimagining our relationship with them."_

Emerging from the question about why digital fabrication, despite its capabilities and accessibility, often feels disconnected from the intuitive creative processes that characterize traditional making, this work started by attempting to trace how creative decision-making authority has been redistributed across different historical moments, concluding that what commonly understood as technological "progress" actually represents specific organizational choices about how human creativity relates to material production.

Through the historical analysis tried to identify the challenges facing contemporary digital fabrication, concluding that they are not primarily technological but organizational. The industrial separation of conception from execution that Harry Braverman identified more than a 100 years ago in _Labor and monopoly capital: the degradation of work in the twentieth century_ continue to manifest themselves in digital workflows through CAD/CAM systems that privilege computational precision over the embodied knowledge and adaptive decision-making central to craft traditions. The craftsperson's unified agency, where creative authority flowed through continuous feedback loops between intention and execution, provided a contrasting model that highlighted what has been systematically eliminated through successive technological "advances." Most crucially, this historical analysis demonstrated that the current distributed agency model represents a choice rather than an inevitability.

The posterior examination of what the fabrication "democratization" means highlighted the inadequacy of access-based approaches that expand tool availability without addressing the workflow architectures that precisely perpetuate the creative fragmentation. By drawing insights from diverse preservation practices (from Cuban automotive adaptation, Māori river stewardship, and FabAcademy and Fabricademy documentation), this research developed an alternative framework that prioritizes the maintenance of adaptive authority over expanding predetermined capabilities. This preservation-based approach recognizes that genuine democratization requires the distribution of decision-making authority throughout creative processes rather than simply expanded access to expert-designed systems.

The experimental interventions progressively refined approaches to preserving embodied knowledge within digital fabrication workflows. CR3ATED showcased that alternative interface designs could preserve material relationships while engaging with digital capabilities, but also revealed the expressive limitations inherent in simplification strategies. The LLM integrations explorations showed how language-mediated interaction could bridge between natural human expression and computational implementation, while highlighting critical distinctions between automation that diminishes agency versus collaboration that enhances creative capabilities, but perhaps most significantly, the AI.RTISANSHIP intervention revealed the fundamental limitations of computational approaches to craft preservation, exposing dimensions of embodied knowledge that systematically resist algorithmic categorization.

The development of Ars Post Faber synthesized these insights into a concrete exploration of how digital fabrication tools might be restructured to preserve unified agency. The plugin's component ecosystem looked to demonstrate that the conception-execution separation is not technologically inevitable while providing tangible opportunities for testing alternative interaction paradigms. Yet the plugin's "significance" lies not in claiming to resolve the challenges identified throughout this research, but in creating concrete opportunities for empirical investigation of the theoretical propositions developed.

The research trajectory highlights an insight that extends beyond digital fabrication to broader questions about human-technology relationships. The challenges identified in contemporary CAD/CAM workflows reflect deeper assumptions about how humans should interact with computational systems—assumptions that privilege machine logic over human cognition, efficiency over creative agency, and predetermined procedures over adaptive response. Contemporary human-machine interaction operates through human adaptation, where humans learn to communicate with machines according to machine logic rather than machines learning to interpret human expression in its natural forms.

The experimental explorations documented in this work suggest several alternative directions for human-machine interaction that might preserve creative agency: conversational computing that enables computational systems to interpret human expression in natural forms, embodied digital manipulation that preserves hand-to-material relationships, real-time adaptive control that maintains material dialogue throughout fabrication processes, and transparent computational processes that enable makers to understand and modify the computational relationships mediating between intention and execution. Besides this, it also questions if the future of digital fabrication may require more radical reimagining than simply improving existing tools or expanding access to current capabilities. At the end, the important question is not how to make CAD/CAM workflows more accessible, but whether entirely different approaches to computer-aided making might better preserve the creative qualities that make fabrication a meaningful human activity. The historical analysis suggested that creative agency depends more on organizational structures than technological capabilities, suggesting that future digital fabrication might need to abandon the CAD/CAM model entirely in favor of organizational approaches that maintain unified creative control throughout making processes.

This investigation concludes not with definitive answers but with productive questions that can only be resolved through sustained engagement by the digital fabrication community. These are several critical questions emerged that require ongoing investigation: Can interaction paradigms that preserve creative agency scale beyond individual maker contexts? Do alternative human-machine interaction approaches genuinely support the development of embodied knowledge, or do they simply create new forms of technological dependency? How will existing fabrication communities respond to tools that challenge established workflow conventions? How might emerging technologies be deployed to support rather than eliminate creative agency within making processes?

The resolution of these questions depends highly on how they are taken up within FabLabs, makerspaces, and educational institutions, where new approaches to human-machine interaction can be tested against actual creative needs and social contexts. These spaces possess the infrastructure, community connections, and approaches necessary for evaluating whether alternative paradigms really enhance creative practice or merely add complexity to existing workflows.

This research positions itself as one experimental approach among many possible directions for reimagining human-machine interaction within creative contexts. It's important to reiterate that the theoretical insights, experimental findings, and technical implementations proposed should be understood as propositions for testing rather than definitive solutions to identified challenges.

Ultimately, this research functions as an invitation to the digital fabrication community to participate in the ongoing exploration of how computational tools might better support human creative potential. The theoretical framework provides the vocabulary for discussing these challenges, the experimental investigations offer insights about interesting pathways for exploration, and the technical implementations create opportunities for empirical testing of alternative approaches. The future of human-machine interaction within creative contexts will emerge through collective experimentation rather than individual innovation.

The research concludes with recognition that its most important contribution may be the questions it raises rather than the answers it provides. How might we completely reimagine the relationship between humans and computational systems? What would digital fabrication look like if it were designed from the beginning to preserve rather than eliminate creative agency? How can we ensure that technological advancement enhances rather than diminishes human creative potential? These questions extend beyond fabrication to broader concerns about how emerging technologies affect human agency, creativity, and autonomy within an increasingly computational world.

Only through sustained engagement by diverse communities of makers, educators, technologists, and scholars will be possible to discover how these questions might be productively addressed. This work concludes not with certainty but with curiosity about what might emerge when human creativity and computational capability are brought into productive dialogue. This experimental spirit represents the recognition that the future of human-machine interaction remains open for creative reimagining by those willing to question current assumptions and explore alternative possibilities.

The conversation continues in workshops, makerspaces, and fab labs around the world, where makers will ultimately determine whether these ideas contribute to more human-centered approaches to technology or simply represent another academic curiosity disconnected from actual creative practice. Time and community engagement will provide the definitive evaluation of whether this research direction proves productive for supporting human creative agency within our increasingly computational world.

[[2]](#_ftnref2) The Industrial Revolution, spanning from 1760 to 1840, marked the transition from manual labor and handicraft economies to mechanized manufacturing. Beginning in Britain and spreading throughout Europe and North America, this period introduced the steam power, factory systems, and mass production techniques that transformed how goods were produced and organized labor relationships.

[[3]](#_ftnref3) Harry Braverman (1920-1976) was an American Marxist economist and labor theorist. As a former metal worker, Braverman analyzed how capitalist production deskilled workers through the separation of mental and manual labor.

[[4]](#_ftnref4) Lord Byron (1788-1824) was a Romantic poet and member of the House of Lords who defended the Luddites in Parliament during the height of their activity, arguing against harsh punitive measures and emphasizing the economic desperation that drove their actions.

[[5]](#_ftnref5) John Ruskin (1819-1900) was an influential Victorian art critic, social thinker, and writer who became one of the leading intellectual voices against industrial capitalism's effects on art, labor, and society.

[[6]](#_ftnref6) William Morris (1834-1896) was a British textile designer, poet, novelist, translator, and social activist who became a central figure in the Arts & Crafts movement. Influenced by John Ruskin's critique of industrial capitalism, Morris founded Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. in 1861, which produced handcrafted furniture, textiles, and decorative arts as an alternative to mass-produced goods.

[[7]](#_ftnref7) Walter Crane (1845-1915) was a British artist and book illustrator, related to the Arts & Crafts movement as both a practitioner and theorist. A founding member of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, Crane advocated for the social and artistic value of handcraft against industrial mass production.
