**Abstract**

Digital fabrication technologies have democratized access to production tools while perpetuating the industrial-era separation between design conception and material execution. This division, which historically diminished artisanship by fragmenting holistic creative processes, continues to manifest in contemporary CAD/CAM workflows that privilege computational precision over the embodied knowledge and tacit decision-making central to craft traditions. Current digital representation formats often reduce creation to pure geometry, failing to preserve the intimate material relationships and adaptive responses that characterize traditional making practices.

This research challenges the assumption that fabrication democratization is achieved solely through access to scaled-down industrial tools. Instead, it argues for a reimagination of the relationship between maker, material, and technology, seeking to restore the holistic nature of creative practice within digital contexts. The following study addresses how to preserve creative agency, embodied knowledge, and capacity for personal expression in digital fabrication contexts.

Through experimental tool testing and digital fabrication workshops with artisans and makers, this research develops **_Ars Post Faber_**, an open-source Grasshopper plug-in within the Rhinoceros CAD environment that approaches making as an integrated practice. The plug-in implements utilities designed to facilitate fluid Human-Software-Machine interactions, enabling embodied expression, contextual adaptation, and tacit knowledge to flow throughout the making process. Rather than abstracting away the creative journey, this approach looks to preserve the complete narrative of creation, including modifications, errors, and decision points, as integral components of the final work.

By attempting to bridge the gap between digital design and material execution, this research looks to contribute to evolving discussions around craft, technology, and creative agency in the digital age, suggesting that true democratization requires representational frameworks that honor the complexity and continuity of human creative processes.

**Chapter 1: The Architecture of Making: Tracing Agency Through Historical and Digital Workflows**

The transformation of making practices from medieval workshops to contemporary digital fabrication represents a reconfiguration of how creative decisions flow through productive processes. To understand current challenges in digital fabrication, it becomes essential to trace how creative agency, defined as "meaningful intentional action" (Niedderer & Townsend, 2024) that enables makers to exercise decision-making authority throughout the making process, has been systematically redistributed across different historical moments and technological contexts.

Medieval artisan guilds operated through integrated knowledge systems where individual craftspeople maintained comprehensive understanding of their entire productive domain. As Richardson (2008) notes, these craft guilds were "organized along trade lines" with members who "shared religious observances and fraternal dinners," creating communities where "guilds ensured production standards were maintained" through collective oversight of the complete production process. The master carpenter knew not only how to shape wood but why specific joints were chosen, when to adapt techniques for different grain patterns, and how environmental conditions would affect long-term structural integrity. This integration of conceptual understanding with material execution created what might be recognized as complete creative agency, decision-making authority distributed throughout the entire making process rather than concentrated in separate planning phases.

The appearance of industrial production altered the foundations of these relationships of agency by introducing systematic specialization. Frederick Winslow Taylor's principles of scientific management exemplified this transformation, advocating for the concentration of knowledge in management roles while reducing workers to executors of predetermined procedures. As Taylor argued, efficiency required " the managers assume, for instance, the burden of gathering together all of the traditional knowledge which in the past has been possessed by the workmen and then of classifying, tabulating, and reducing this knowledge to rules, laws, and formulae which are immensely helpful to the workmen in doing their daily work." (Taylor, 1919). This extraction and centralization of craft knowledge created the foundation for what Harry Braverman later identified in _Labor and Monopoly Capital_ (1974) as the systematic separation of conception from execution, a division that fundamentally altered the relationship between thinking and making that had characterized traditional craft practice.

However, this transformation did not proceed unopposed. From the direct resistance of Luddism against mechanization to the reformist proposals of the _Arts & Crafts_ movement, various social movements emerged to challenge the dehumanization of productive work. The Luddites, British textile workers active between 1811-1816, responded to industrial mechanization not through blanket opposition to technology, but as historian Malcolm I. Thomis observed, because machine-breaking represented a strategic form of "collective bargaining by riot" (Thomis, 1993) when orthodox negotiation was impossible due to restrictive anti-union legislation and the scattered nature of industrial work. As Thomis documented, "machine-breaking was, of course, by no means a new phenomenon when it appeared in Nottinghamshire in March 1811, being almost a time-honoured tradition among certain occupational groups," (Thomis, 1993) used to "effectively and quickly strike at an offensive local employer." (Thomis, 1993) Crucially, Thomis noted that "these attacks on machines did not imply any necessary hostility to machinery as such; machinery was just a conveniently exposed target against which an attack could be made" (Thomis, 1993). As Lord Byron argued in Parliament during the height of Luddite activity, these " outrages must be admitted to exist to an alarming extent, it cannot be denied that they have arisen from circumstances of the most unparalleled distress" (Byron, 1812), driven by "absolute want" when skilled craftsmen found "their own means of subsistence were cut off" by mechanization (Byron, 1812).

The Arts & Crafts movement, emerging later in the century, offered a more sustained intellectual critique of industrial production's effects on creative agency. John Ruskin, the movement's intellectual foundation, argued in _The Stones of Venice_ that industrial mechanization represented a fundamental assault on human dignity, writing that "we have much studied and much perfected, of late, the great civilized invention of the division of labour; only we give it a false name. It is not, truly speaking, the labour that is divided; but the men: Divided into mere segments of men, broken into small fragments and crumbs of life" (Ruskin, 1892). William Morris, inspired by Ruskin's critique, sought to restore what he called "art which is made by the people and for the people, as a happiness to the maker and the user (Morris 1996)", advocating for production methods that would reunite intellectual conception with manual execution. Morris believed that creative work should demonstrate "obvious traces of the hand of man guided directly by his brain, without more interposition of machines than is absolutely necessary to the nature of the work done" (Morris, 1882).

These movements shared a fundamental concern: the industrial division of labor threatened not merely economic arrangements but the essential human capacity for creative agency. Walter Crane, first president of the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society, articulated this critique in _The Claims of Decorative Art_ (1892), arguing that "the apotheosis of commercialism meant the degradation of art" and lamenting that under industrial conditions "there can be no possibility of the pleasure of the craftsman in fashioning his work, to give it the individual twist and play of fancy, the little touch of grace and ornamental feeling springing from the organic necessities of the work which is characteristic of the times when art and handicraft were united and living." Crane specifically attacked how industrialization had created a world where "all the useful labours are made either terrible by long hours, or emptied of all joy and interest by being reduced to mechanism" (Crane, 1892). His vision opposed the industrial reduction of workers to mere components, advocating instead for the reunification of art and handicraft that had been systematically divided by mechanization.

Yet despite their moral urgency, these resistance movements could not halt the broader trajectory toward systematic separation of conception from execution that would later characterize digital fabrication workflows.

**Contemporary Digital Workflows: Extending Historical Fragmentation**

Contemporary digital design workflows extend this historical fragmentation into new technological domains, perpetuating the separation Braverman observed through software architectures and computational processes. The traditional craftsperson's embodied knowledge, held in hands, eyes, and intuitive understanding of materials, becomes progressively abstracted through layers of digital mediation. Modern CAD/CAM systems create distinct operational phases: human conceptualization, software translation, machine execution, and material output. Each transition representing a potential loss of agency, as the maker's intentionality becomes increasingly distant from the final artifact.

Contemporary digital design workflows perpetuate this historical fragmentation through their fundamental architecture and representational logic. Current CAD/CAM systems create distinct operational phases that mirror the industrial separation Braverman documented: human conceptualization in design software, algorithmic translation happens through file processing, machine execution follows predetermined paths, and material output emerges as the final step. Each transition represents a potential loss of agency, as the maker's intentionality becomes increasingly mediated through technological intermediaries that may not preserve the original creative reasoning behind design decisions.

Research _Embodied Knowledge in Digital Spaces: Towards Human-Centered Fabrication Formats_ suggests that "current representation formats prioritize geometric precision over embodied knowledge, reducing complex creative processes to coordinates and mechanical instructions" (Muñoz, 2025). The dominance of formats like G-code, which controls CNC machines and 3D printers through standardized commands, exemplifies how digital workflows eliminate the experiential knowledge that craftspeople traditionally embedded within their making processes. These technical standards capture precise geometric specifications but cannot encode the tacit understanding, material sensitivity, or adaptive decision-making that characterized unified craft practice.

This technological fragmentation operates at multiple levels simultaneously. Beyond the limitations of individual file formats, entire workflow architectures perpetuate the conception-execution divide through their structural organization. Contemporary digital fabrication requires users to navigate between specialized software environments: Computer Aided Design applications for conceptufalization, Computer Aided Manufacturing programs for toolpath generation, and machine-specific control interfaces for execution. Each software transition introduces potential "breakdown points", moments where creative flow encounters systemic resistance or translation errors. The cumulative effect transforms the continuous dialogue between maker and material that characterized traditional craft into a series of discrete, mediated steps where creative agency becomes attenuated with each technological translation.

**Mapping Agency: From Unified to Fragmented Control**

The historical trajectory traced from medieval guilds through industrial mechanization to contemporary digital workflows reveals a systematic redistribution of creative control that demands more precise analytical examination. This transformation represents not merely technological evolution, but a restructuring of how decision-making authority flows through productive processes. To understand the implications for contemporary digital fabrication, it becomes necessary to map these different configurations of agency as distinct organizational forms, each embodying particular relationships between human intention, technological mediation, and material execution.

_Unified Agency: The Craftsperson's Integrated Practice_

Traditional craft practice operated through what this research terms unified agency, a configuration where conceptual understanding, material manipulation, and adaptive decision-making remain integrated within the craftsperson's direct control. This represents more than the romantic notion of "hands-on" making; it constitutes a particular organizational form where creative authority flows through continuous feedback loops between intention and execution.

David Pye's concept of the "workmanship of risk" captures this configuration precisely: "the quality of the result is not predetermined, but depends on the judgment, dexterity and care which the maker exercises as he works" (Pye, 1971, p. 20). The craftsperson's tools function as what Andy Clark and David Chalmers describe as extensions of an "extended mind"; transparent intermediaries that amplify human capability without introducing systematic barriers between creative intention and material response (Clark & Chalmers, 1998).

Crucially, unified agency enables what might be called _adaptive authority_: the capacity to modify design decisions based on material feedback, unexpected discoveries, or emergent possibilities that arise during the making process. The medieval carpenter adjusting joint techniques based on wood grain patterns exemplifies this adaptive authority, where creative control remains responsive to material conditions rather than predetermined by separate planning phases.

_Distributed Agency: Industrial and Digital Fragmentation_

The industrial transformation traced through Taylorism and later digital workflows created what this research identifies as distributed agency: a configuration where creative control becomes systematically fragmented across separate operational domains, each governed by different logical systems and often different human operators. This represents a qualitatively different organizational form from unified agency, not merely a technological updating of traditional craft practice.

Distributed agency operates through what theorists recognize as _sequential specialization_: creative authority becomes divided among discrete phases where each stage operates according to its own technical logic and constraints (Enfield & Kockelman, 2017). The Taylorist separation of planning from execution established this pattern, but digital workflows extend it through technological mediation that introduces additional layers of fragmentation.

Contemporary CAD/CAM systems exemplify this distributed configuration through their multi-stage architecture: conceptual design occurs within parametric modeling environments, geometric processing happens through file format translations, toolpath generation follows manufacturing optimization algorithms, and material execution proceeds through machine control protocols. Each stage embeds particular assumptions about what constitutes relevant information, creating systematic filtering that may eliminate precisely the kinds of adaptive responses that characterized unified agency.

_The Loss of Adaptive Authority_

The critical difference between unified and distributed agency lies not simply in the number of technological intermediaries involved, but in the systematic elimination of what this research terms _adaptive authority_, beign the capacity for real-time modification of creative decisions based on emergent conditions. Traditional craft practice embedded this adaptive capacity throughout the making process, enabling continuous negotiation between intention and material response.

Distributed agency, by contrast, concentrates adaptive authority within the initial design phase while rendering subsequent stages increasingly deterministic. Once geometric specifications are locked into CAD files and translated through manufacturing software, the system resists the kinds of responsive modifications that characterized traditional craft dialogue between maker and material. This represents what Terry Winograd identified as "breakdown points" (Winograd, 1986), moments where the technological system's logical structure conflicts with the adaptive nature of creative practice.

The emergence of increasingly sophisticated computational processes, from parametric optimization to AI-generated design variations, intensifies rather than resolves this fundamental structural limitation. These developments may increase the sophistication of initial design exploration, but they operate within the same distributed architecture that systematically concentrates creative authority in separate planning phases while rendering material execution increasingly automated and non-responsive.

_Toward Alternative Configurations_

Understanding agency as organizationally configured rather than technologically determined suggests possibilities for alternative approaches to digital fabrication. Rather than accepting the distributed model as inevitable, this research explores whether digital systems might be structured to preserve adaptive authority throughout the making process, enabling the continuous dialogue between intention and material response that characterized unified craft practice while leveraging the capabilities of contemporary fabrication technologies.

_[Figure 3: Toward Integrated Digital Agency diagram]_

**Reclaiming Agency Within Technological Constraints**

This historical trajectory from unified craft practice through industrial fragmentation to contemporary digital workflows reveals that the challenge facing makers today is not technological limitation but organizational structure. The tools themselves: CNC machines, 3D printers, parametric design software represent unprecedented capabilities for material manipulation and geometric exploration. Yet their integration within distributed agency frameworks systematically eliminates the adaptive authority that enabled traditional craftspeople to maintain creative control throughout the making process.

The question is not whether to embrace or reject these technological capabilities, but how to reorganize their deployment in ways that restore human creative agency. Current approaches to fabrication "democratization" have focused primarily on access, making industrial machines smaller, cheaper, and more widely available, without addressing the fundamental workflow architectures that perpetuate the separation of conception from execution that Braverman identified as central to industrial production methods.

This represents a false choice between technological sophistication and human creativity. The medieval craftsperson's unified agency emerged not from the absence of tools but from organizational structures that preserved adaptive authority throughout the making process. Contemporary digital systems possess far greater material capabilities than traditional hand tools, yet their current organizational deployment fragments rather than enhances human creative control.

The path forward requires a _tactical appropriation_, working within existing technological ecosystems while reorganizing their operational logic to restore the continuous dialogue between intention and material response that characterized traditional craft practice. This means developing approaches that leverage computational precision and automated execution while preserving the maker's capacity for real-time adaptation, contextual response, and embodied decision-making.

Rather than rejecting digital fabrication systems, the following chapters of this research will explore how their representational frameworks might be restructured to honor what Walter Crane described as the craftsperson's capacity "to give it the individual twist and play of fancy, the little touch of grace and ornamental feeling springing from the organic necessities of the work", those responsive creative decisions that emerge when maker and material remain in continuous dialogue throughout the making process. Unlike the Luddites' strategic machine-breaking or the Arts & Crafts movement's wholesale rejection of industrial methods, this approach recognizes that contemporary technological capabilities need not inevitably fragment creative agency. The challenge lies not in the machines themselves but in reorganizing how they are deployed within making workflows. The following chapters examine how such appropriation might operate in practice, suggesting pathways toward post-industrial craft, making practices that combine contemporary technological capabilities with organizational structures that preserve human creative agency without requiring retreat from digital fabrication's material possibilities.

**Chapter 2: Rethinking Democratization: Beyond Access to Preservation**

**The Access Paradigm and Its Achievements**

Contemporary digital fabrication has positioned itself as democratization through access. Neil Gershenfeld's foundational vision for FabLabs promised "personal fabrication" enabling "almost anyone to make almost anything" (Gershenfeld, 2007), while Mark Hatch advocated for "radically democratizing access to the tools of innovation" (Hatch, 2013). This approach has achieved remarkable quantitative success: from fewer than 50 FabLabs worldwide in 2009 to over 2,000 by 2023 (Fab Foundation, 2024), representing unprecedented expansion of access to sophisticated production capabilities.

This material democratization extends beyond physical tools to software infrastructures. Open-source CAD alternatives like FreeCAD, combined with educational programs for professional tools, have reduced barriers to digital design literacy. Contemporary maker spaces enable individual access to CNC machines, 3D printers, and laser cutters for modest fees, genuinely transforming the economic conditions of making.

Yet this access-focused paradigm reveals fundamental limitations when examined against historical precedents of successful democratization movements. The expansion of who can use fabrication tools does not address how those tools structure creative agency within making processes. As Tanenbaum et al. observe, maker practices still depend heavily on existing industrial infrastructure and face challenges "when it comes to scaling up production and distribution" (Tanenbaum et al., 2013).

**The Preservation Problem**

What contemporary digital fabrication lacks is what this research identifies as the preservation problem: while expanding tool access, current approaches have not developed methods for capturing and transmitting the tacit knowledge and embodied practices that characterize skilled making. Richard Sennett's analysis emphasizes that "the desire to do something well for its own sake" requires forms of embodied learning that resist systematic codification (Sennett, 2008).

This preservation problem manifests through persistent organizational structures. Despite the collaborative and educational dimensions of maker spaces, the fundamental workflow architecture maintains the distributed agency pattern traced in Chapter 1. Creative decisions remain concentrated in separate design phases, while material execution follows predetermined procedures that eliminate opportunities for the responsive adaptation characterizing traditional craft.

The critical insight is that democratization cannot be achieved through access alone, it requires organizational innovation that preserves the continuity of creative decision-making throughout the making process. This shifts focus from who can use fabrication tools to how those tools can be structured to maintain unified agency.

**Redefining Democratization: Process Over Access**

Building on this analysis, genuine democratization of fabrication requires a fundamental reorientation from access-based to preservation-based approaches. Rather than simply expanding who can use digital fabrication tools, preservation-based democratization focuses on developing representational frameworks and workflow architectures capable of maintaining the continuous dialogue between maker, machine, and material that characterized traditional craft practice.

This approach recognizes that the challenge is not technological but organizational: how to structure digital fabrication systems to preserve the adaptive authority and embodied decision-making that enabled craftspeople to maintain unified agency, while leveraging contemporary fabrication capabilities. Such preservation-based democratization would need to address several interconnected challenges that current approaches have not resolved.

The following sections examine how other domains have approached democratization not merely through access expansion, but through fundamental transformation of processes, representation systems, and participatory structures. These historical precedents reveal patterns that suggest alternative pathways for fabrication democratization beyond the current focus on tool access.

**Deconstructing "Democratization": What Democracy Actually Requires**

Before examining fabrication's current limitations, it becomes essential to interrogate what "democratization" actually means and why the term has been misapplied to contemporary digital fabrication contexts. The word "democracy" derives from the Greek δημοκρατία (demokratia): demos (people) + kratos (power/rule), literally meaning "rule by the people." Yet this etymology reveals the inadequacy of access-based approaches to fabrication democratization.

**Democracy as Distributed Decision-Making Authority**

Political democracy, at its core, requires the distribution of decision-making authority among participants rather than merely access to predetermined decision-making processes. As Robert Dahl's foundational analysis demonstrates, democratic systems must provide "effective participation" (Dahl, 1989) where citizens have " basic political rights and liberties, such as free expression, and allows persons to live under laws of their own choosing" (Dahl, 1989), and enlightened understanding enabling informed choice among alternatives. Crucially, democracy requires what Dahl terms "final control over the agenda" (Dahl, 2017), the authority to determine not just outcomes within predetermined options, but the capacity to define what questions get asked and how they are framed. This distinguishes genuine democratic participation from consultative processes that solicit input within predetermined parameters while concentrating agenda-setting authority elsewhere.

Applied to fabrication contexts, genuine democratization would require the distribution of creative decision-making authority throughout making processes rather than simply expanded access to predetermined fabrication procedures. Current maker spaces, despite their collaborative ethos, preserve what might be called 'fabrication autocracy' a concentrated creative authority in separate design phases, while relegating material execution to predetermined procedures that eliminate participant agency.

**The Representation Problem in Fabrication Democracy**

Political democracy confronts the fundamental challenge of representation: _how to enable large-scale collective decision-making while preserving individual agency?_ This requires sophisticated institutional frameworks, electoral systems, deliberative processes, and constitutional protections that mediate between individual preferences and collective outcomes without eliminating personal autonomy.

Fabrication democratization faces analogous representational challenges: _how to enable sophisticated material manipulation while preserving maker agency throughout creative processes?_ Yet current digital fabrication has developed no equivalent to democratic political institutions. Instead, it has adopted what might be termed "technocratic representation"; expert-designed software interfaces and standardized file formats that mediate between human intention and material execution while eliminating opportunities for maker input beyond initial design specification.

This technocratic approach mirrors Joseph Schumpeter's theory of democracy as "competitive leadership" (Schumpeter, 1950), a system that preserves formal democratic procedures while concentrating substantive decision-making authority within expert institutions. Just as this democracy enables citizen participation within predetermined choices while eliminating popular control over agenda-setting, current fabrication democratization enables maker participation within predetermined workflow structures while eliminating creative authority over how those structures operate.

**Participatory Democracy and Making**

Participatory democratic theory offers more relevant models for genuine fabrication democratization. Theorists like Carole Pateman argue that democracy requires " a participatory society to exist, i.e. a society where all political systems have been democratised and socialisation through participation can take place in all areas" (Pateman, 1976). This approach recognizes that democratic capacity develops through practice; people learn democratic skills by exercising democratic authority rather than through formal instruction about democratic procedures.

Pateman's emphasis on workplace democratization proves particularly relevant for fabrication contexts. She argues that "most individuals spend a great deal of their lifetime at work and the business of the workplace provides an education in the management of collective affairs that it is difficult to parallel elsewhere" (Pateman, 1976), and that spheres like industry "should be seen as political systems in their own right, offering areas of participation additional to the national level" (Pateman, 1976). If individuals are to exercise control over their lives and environment, then "authority structures in these areas must be so organised that they can participate in decision making."

Applied to fabrication, participatory democracy would suggest that making skills develop through exercising creative authority throughout material processes rather than through instruction about predetermined fabrication procedures. This perspective challenges current "maker education" approaches that emphasize tool training and safety procedures while preserving expert-designed workflow structures that eliminate opportunities for developing creative agency.

**Deconstructing "Preservation": Beyond Cultural Heritage Models**

The concept of "preservation" requires similar critical examination, as its application to craft knowledge has been influenced by cultural heritage frameworks that may not adequately address the dynamic nature of living making practices. Understanding preservation through cross-cultural perspectives reveals assumptions embedded within Western conservation models and suggests alternative approaches more suitable for maintaining creative agency within digital fabrication contexts.

**Preservation as Dynamic Process vs. Static Conservation**

Traditional cultural preservation models, developed primarily for archaeological and architectural contexts, emphasize conservation of existing artifacts and documentation of historical practices. This approach, rooted in Western museum culture, treats cultural objects as fixed entities requiring protection from change rather than as elements within ongoing living traditions.

The 2003 UNESCO Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage marked a conceptual shift by recognizing that cultural heritage extends beyond physical monuments to include "identification, documentation, research, preservation, protection, promotion, enhancement, transmission" (UNESCO, 2003). Crucially, the Convention defines intangible cultural heritage as something that is "constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment" (UNESCO, 2003), explicitly acknowledging its living, evolving nature.

Yet even this progressive framework continues to operate through categories that emphasize authenticity verification and systematic documentation over adaptation and innovation. The UNESCO approach, while acknowledging living practices, still requires "identification, documentation, research, preservation, protection, promotion, enhancement, transmission" (UNESCO, 2003), processes that tend to crystallize traditions into documentable forms rather than preserving their adaptive capacity.

**Cross-Cultural Models of Adaptive Preservation**

Examining preservation practices across different cross-cultural contexts reveals alternative approaches that prioritize functionality and relationship continuity over material authenticity or procedural fixity.

_Cuban Automobile Preservation: Functionality Through Adaptation_

Cuba's preservation of classic American automobiles exemplifies what can be termed "functional preservation", maintaining cultural significance through continuous adaptation rather than static conservation. Following the 1959 Cuban Revolution and subsequent U.S. embargo, Cubans maintained an estimated 60,000 classic American cars through creative adaptation, with "There are an estimated 60,000 classic American cars in Cuba. About half of the cars originate from the 1950s, while 25 percent are from the 1940s and another 25 percent are from the 1930s. A lot of them have been passed down from generation to generation, along with the mechanical genius" (Diplomatic Times, 2019).

These vehicles remain culturally significant not despite their modifications but because of them; "many of the cars have survived more than six decades, and through clever adaptation and ingenuity, have been kept running by their owners" (Diplomatic Times, 2019). External appearances preserve historical recognition value while internal systems have evolved into hybrid assemblages. "A common substitution on the old 1950s era cars on the island are diesel engines for the old straight-six or V-8 engines originally in the cars, due to diesel's lower cost on the island, and the better fuel efficiency of the engines" and that "it is not unusual for some of the original V-8 engines to be replaced by diesel engines from Russian trucks or boats" (Diplomatic Times, 2019).

This preservation approach prioritizes ongoing functionality and cultural continuity over strict material authenticity. The cars remain integrated within contemporary Cuban life, functioning as taxis and tourist attractions rather than museum pieces, demonstrating preservation through active use rather than protection from use.

_Māori River Preservation: Relational Continuity Through Legal Innovation_

New Zealand's legal recognition of the Whanganui River as a living entity with "the same rights and responsibilities as a person" (Pāremata Aotearoa, 2017) exemplifies preservation through transformed conceptual frameworks rather than material conservation. This approach emerged from Māori understanding expressed in the saying "Ko au te awa, ko te awa ko au" (I am the river, and the river is me), where the river name "Awa Tupua" encompasses "the whole river system, its spirit, and the people that are related to it" (National Library of New Zealand, 2017).

Rather than treating the river as a natural resource requiring protection through regulatory restriction, this model empowers the Māori to manage and protect the river based on their traditional ecological knowledge, as VijayKumar notes: "As a consequence of this recognition, the Maori are now empowered to manage and protect the river based on their traditional ecological knowledge" (VijayKumar, 2019). Preservation here operates through maintaining relationships and ongoing interactions rather than controlling physical attributes or preventing change.

This relational approach recognizes that preservation must account for living connections between people, practices, and environments rather than treating cultural elements as discrete objects requiring isolation from contemporary influences.

_Implications for Inangible Knowledge Preservation_

These diverse preservation models, from Cuban functional adaptation to Māori relational continuity, reveal shared principles that challenge Western conservation assumptions. Both prioritize process over product, relationships over artifacts, and adaptation over stasis. Both recognize that genuine preservation requires maintaining the conditions that enable ongoing cultural vitality rather than documenting static cultural forms.

Applied to digital intangible knowledge preservation, these principles suggest that effective approaches should capture process knowledge and decision-making rather than just final geometries, preserve the dynamic relationship between maker, material, and tool, and allow for adaptation and evolution rather than freezing techniques in time.

**Preservation as Structural Maintenance**

From this cross-cultural perspective, intangible knowledge preservation becomes analogous to ecological preservation, which maintains ecosystem health through preserving functional relationships rather than individual species populations. Just as ecological preservation focuses on maintaining the processes that enable ecosystem adaptation and resilience, intangible knowledge preservation would focus on maintaining the organizational structures that enable ongoing creative development.

Yet skilled making practices have always been evolutionary rather than static. Traditional craft knowledge developed through continuous adaptation to changing materials, tools, technologies, and cultural contexts. What characterized these traditions was not procedural fixity but adaptive capacity: the ability to maintain creative authority while responding to new conditions. As Cuban mechanics demonstrate through automotive adaptation and as Māori communities demonstrate through evolving river stewardship, living traditions preserve their essential character through responsive modification rather than rigid conservation.

This approach suggests that genuine preservation requires creating conditions where skilled making practices can continue developing rather than simply documenting how they currently operate. Current digital fabrication's focus on explicit documentation, tutorials, parametric models, procedural instructions that represent a "museum preservation" approach, an approach that captures surface manifestations while eliminating the underlying adaptive capacity that enabled those practices to develop historically.

**Dynamic Preservation as Democratic Practice**

The connection between preservation and democratization becomes apparent when examining how different preservation approaches distribute authority over cultural development. Static preservation concentrates interpretive authority within expert institutions that determine authentic forms and appropriate practices. Dynamic preservation, by contrast, maintains community authority over ongoing cultural adaptation, determining how traditions should evolve in response to changing conditions.

Cuban automobile preservation maintains community control over technological adaptation; Māori river stewardship preserves Indigenous authority over environmental relationship. Both models demonstrate how preservation can function as democratic practice that maintains cultural agency rather than transferring it to external conservation institutions.

Applied to digital fabrication, this can suggest that preservation-based democratization would focus on maintaining maker authority over creative adaptation rather than expanding access to predetermined fabrication procedures. Just as Cuban mechanics maintain automotive culture through responsive modification and Māori communities maintain river relationships through evolving stewardship practices, intangible knowledge preservation would need to maintain the adaptive authority that enables creative traditions to develop continuously in response to new technological possibilities.

This represents a "rupture" from current fabrication democratization approaches, which expand access to expert-designed systems while preserving the organizational structures that concentrate creative authority in separate design phases. True preservation-based democratization would require developing representational frameworks and workflow architectures that maintain creative agency throughout making processes, enabling the continuous dialogue between maker, material, and technology that has characterized living craft traditions in the past.

**Documentation as Process Preservation: Beyond Static Recording**

The preservation challenges identified in Cuban automotive adaptation and Māori river stewardship extend directly into contemporary digital fabrication through documentation practices that undermine rather than support genuine democratization. While the previous analysis revealed how both dynamic preservation and democratic participation require maintaining adaptive authority within ongoing practices, current fabrication documentation operates through the same technocratic representation that characterizes Schumpeterian democracy—enabling participation within predetermined procedures while eliminating authority over how those procedures operate.

Standard fabrication documentation—CAD files, parameter lists, step-by-step tutorials—exemplifies this technocratic approach, functioning as expert-designed interfaces that mediate between human intention and material execution while systematically eliminating opportunities for creative input beyond initial design specification. This documentation architecture perpetuates the distributed agency pattern traced in Chapter 1, concentrating decision-making authority in separate phases while rendering subsequent stages increasingly automated and non-responsive.

Yet examining documentation practices across different educational and experimental contexts reveals alternative approaches that align with both the dynamic preservation principles demonstrated by Cuban mechanics and Māori river stewardship and the participatory democratic theory that emphasizes learning through exercising authority. These examples suggest pathways toward documentation frameworks capable of supporting preservation-based democratization by maintaining the continuity of creative decision-making that characterizes unified agency, even within digital fabrication contexts.

**Educational Documentation as Process Preservation**

The FabAcademy and Fabricademy documentation sites provide compelling examples of documentation that captures learning processes rather than just technical outcomes. Unlike traditional technical manuals that present polished procedures, these educational platforms require students to document their entire learning journey, including failed experiments, debugging processes, and iterative refinements.

FabAcademy student documentation reveals the authentic progression of skill development through detailed weekly logs that include "what worked," "what didn't work," and "what I learned." Students document not only successful fabrication outcomes but also the problem-solving processes that led to those outcomes. A typical FabAcademy documentation entry might include: failed 3D print attempts with analysis of what caused the failure, iterative adjustments to printing parameters, and reflection on how material behavior differed from expectations.

This approach recognizes that learning fabrication skills requires experiencing and working through failures rather than simply following successful procedures. The documentation becomes a record of adaptive authority in action: students learning to modify their approaches based on material feedback, equipment limitations, and emergent discoveries. As one FabAcademy graduate noted, "the real learning happened in the failures—that's where I had to really understand what was happening instead of just following instructions."

Fabricademy extends this process-oriented documentation to textile and bio-material fabrication, where material unpredictability requires even greater adaptive capacity. Students document experiments with living materials, bacterial cultures, and organic dyes—processes where following predetermined procedures often fails and creative adaptation becomes essential. The resulting documentation captures not just final recipes but the iterative process of material negotiation that characterizes traditional craft knowledge.

**Digital Workflows as Narrative Preservation**

Tran O'Leary et al.'s Tandem system represents another approach to process-oriented documentation, implementing entire fabrication workflows as computational notebooks that preserve the complete narrative of creation. Rather than abstracting away the making process into separate CAD/CAM phases, Tandem maintains continuity between design decisions and material execution through what the authors term "reproducible fabrication workflows."

Crucially, Tandem's approach acknowledges that reproduction is not repetition—each implementation of a workflow involves contextual adaptations based on available materials, equipment variations, and maker expertise. The system preserves decision-making authority by enabling users to modify workflow parameters while maintaining the underlying logical structure that connects intention to execution.

The Tandem approach reveals how digital documentation might preserve adaptive authority rather than eliminating it. By implementing workflows as modifiable programs rather than fixed procedures, the system enables what might be called "generative reproduction"—the capacity to maintain creative agency while building on previous work. This represents a significant departure from standard CAD/CAM workflows that concentrate creative decisions in separate design phases while rendering material execution increasingly automated.

**The Paradox of Complete Documentation**

Yet even these progressive documentation approaches encounter fundamental limitations when attempting to capture the full complexity of skilled making processes. The challenge becomes apparent when examining attempts to document tacit knowledge through advanced technological means, as revealed by experimental approaches to craft preservation through machine learning and computer vision systems.

**Learning from Failure: The AI.RTISANSHIP Experiment and the Limits of Technical Preservation**

The AI.RTISANSHIP experiment provides a critical case study for understanding the limitations of technical approaches to intangible knowledge preservation. By attempting to capture and digitize traditional pottery techniques through computer vision and machine learning systems, this experiment revealed fundamental contradictions between technological documentation capabilities and the essential characteristics of skilled making practices.

**The Experiment: Digitizing Embodied Knowledge**

AI.RTISANSHIP employed MediaPipe computer vision systems to track and analyze the hand movements, body positioning, and temporal patterns of skilled ceramic artists working at the pottery wheel. The goal was ambitious: to create a machine learning system capable of analyzing artisanal techniques and potentially serving as a "virtual assistant" for craft learning.

The technical implementation succeeded in capturing detailed movement data—hand trajectories, pressure variations, temporal rhythms, and spatial relationships between artisan and material. The computer vision system could detect and classify different phases of the pottery-making process: centering the clay, opening the form, pulling walls, and shaping the final vessel. Machine learning algorithms identified patterns in successful throwing sequences and attempted to correlate specific movements with successful outcomes.

Yet the experiment's technical success revealed its fundamental limitation: digitization could record movements but could not capture the decision-making processes that guided those movements. As Richard Sennett observes, skilled craftsmanship emerges from "constant dialogue between concrete practices and thinking," a dialogue that depends on "direct experience, practice, and the obstacles and resistances that the artisan encounters" (Sennett, 2008).

**The Unmeasurable Dimensions of Craft Knowledge**

The AI.RTISANSHIP experiment revealed that craft knowledge operates through dimensions that resist systematic documentation. Computer vision could detect hand positions but could not access the tactile feedback that informed those positions—the subtle resistance of clay that indicates proper centering, the texture changes that signal optimal moisture content, or the minute vibrations that warn of impending collapse.

More significantly, the system could not capture what this research terms "contextual decision-making": the continuous stream of micro-adjustments that skilled artisans make in response to material behavior. Each piece of clay presents unique characteristics based on its composition, preparation, and environmental conditions. The skilled potter develops sensitivity to these variations through accumulated experience, enabling real-time adaptation that optimizes technique for specific material conditions.

The experiment demonstrated that even advanced documentation technologies encounter what might be called the "tacit knowledge barrier." The essential knowledge that enables skilled making resists externalization not because of technological limitations but because it operates through embodied, contextual, and experiential dimensions that exist only within the integrated system of maker, material, and tool.

**Lessons for Digital Fabrication Preservation**

The AI.RTISANSHIP experiment provides crucial insights for developing more effective approaches to intangible knowledge preservation within digital fabrication contexts. Rather than viewing the experiment as a failure, its limitations reveal important principles for preservation-based democratization.

First, the experiment confirms that preservation efforts should focus on maintaining conditions for skill development rather than capturing specific techniques. Just as Cuban mechanics maintain automotive culture through responsive adaptation rather than procedural adherence, craft preservation requires preserving the organizational structures that enable ongoing creative development.

Second, the experiment reveals that obstacles and resistance play essential roles in skill development. As Sennett argues, "it is the obstacles and resistances encountered that develop artisanal practice and understanding." This suggests that effective preservation approaches should document failure modes, problem-solving processes, and adaptive responses rather than just successful outcomes.

Third, the experiment demonstrates that uniqueness and unrepeatability are not limitations to overcome but essential characteristics to preserve. Each ceramic vessel emerges from an "unrepeatable moment of interaction between the artisan, the material, and the specific circumstances." Similarly, each implementation of a digital fabrication workflow should preserve the capacity for contextual adaptation rather than enforcing standardized repetition.

**Implications for Digital Fabrication Workflows**

These insights suggest that digital fabrication systems should be designed to preserve what the AI.RTISANSHIP experiment revealed as the unmeasurable dimensions of creative practice. Rather than abstracting away material feedback and eliminating opportunities for adaptive response, digital workflows should maintain channels for embodied decision-making throughout the making process.

This requires organizational innovation rather than technological advancement. Current CAD/CAM systems possess sophisticated capabilities for material simulation and automated optimization, yet their workflow architectures systematically eliminate the continuous dialogue between maker and material that characterizes skilled practice. The challenge lies not in developing better measurement systems but in reorganizing existing technological capabilities to preserve unified agency.

The following chapters examine how such reorganization might operate in practice, building on the insights revealed through both the documentation analysis and the AI.RTISANSHIP experiment to develop concrete approaches for preserving creative agency within digital fabrication contexts.

---

_The AI.RTISANSHIP experiment reveals that the question is not how to faithfully preserve something whose essence lies in its unrepeatability, but how to preserve the conditions that enable unrepeatability to continue emerging. This shifts focus from capturing specific techniques to maintaining the organizational structures that enable ongoing creative adaptation—the heart of genuine preservation-based democratization._
