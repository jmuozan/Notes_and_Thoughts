What it really means to have democratized fabrication.
There are more than 2000 fablabs around the world, but does that really mean that there's more access to frabication????


Maybe state education should guarantee that "maker education" is embedded in education itself rather than being a complementary thing.

Could curriculums be adapted to include maker ed. inside traditional courses? 

How can academany porgrams be adapted into highschools????
